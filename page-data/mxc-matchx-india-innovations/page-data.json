The bustling business sector across the subcontinent offers significant depth for MXC as well as Indian customers to lead, innovate and create the Smart Cities of tomorrow.\n\nMXC recently signed deals with partners in Hyderabad and Jaipur both of these [Indian state capitals are looking to develop inter-city connectivity](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-in-korea-russia-india)  to ensure their cities work smarter and become more intuitive, allowing for innovation to flourish for locals across the vast Indian state regions of Telangana and Rajasthan respectively. \n\nThe agreement will see a significant boost to LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) infrastructure across the region, allowing the Internet of Things and their subsequent devices to connect over extreme distances, covering up to 40km with a single data network. All of this will be achieved using extremely low power, something that is not only a necessity in an environmentally green deal, but also a key point for a region in India that frequently experiences connectivity losses. The technology itself will also see a much needed boost for the Crypto scene in India, with the hardware powered by a Blockchain solution developed by the MXC Foundation. Users will be able to pay to receive and send data using cryptocurrency, a subject that has been under a consistent cloud within India. However, the MXC team believes that by showing real world solutions incorporated with Crypto, India can be a shining light, demonstrating secure Crypto usage can increase functionality in the future of Indian Smart Cities. \n\n“MXC is excited to work with the Indian cities of Hyderabad and Jaipur, yes, connecting devices is at the heart of what we do, but more importantly we connect people. India is an extremely innovative and vibrant region for Smart City development with many government officials showing a key interest in working with the technology solutions of tomorrow to ensure they stay on the cutting edge of  future developments to best serve their constituents” said MXC Co-Founder Aaron Wagener\n\nThe development of Indian Smart City technology across Hyderabad and Jaipur will include local authorities, distribution partners as well as MXC and the hardware developer of the LPWAN Gateways, MatchX. \n\nBased in Berlin, MatchX delivers the hardware required to improve Indian Smart City innovations ensuring sensor connectivity with their innovative “M2 Pro”. One MatchX M2 Pro Gateway requires less than 5 Watts to operate, can service communities up to 40 km away and can connect to thousands upon thousands of Smart City sensors. The deal itself is expected to power the next generation of Smart City innovation across India and increase Indian citizens adoption of crypto throughout the region. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe MXC Foundation is a purpose-built Blockchain Foundation, based in Berlin.
