Last week, we announced the monumental Sichuan Government partnership. The development on the partnership has been growing steadily and fast! Meanwhile, we have decided to update our community on our legal action against the “MXC Exchange”, that continues to violate our trademark – recognized worldwide.

*This is the original script of the MXC News Update, uploaded on July 20, 2020.*

Good morning, and happy Monday! Welcome to this week’s MXC News Update!
A lot of you have been waiting for the BIG news this week, so let’s get straight into it.

## Szechuan Government Partnership Developing
MXC signed a partnership with the government of Szechuan, as we announced last week. The partnership saw the Szechuan government giving a generous grant to MXC. To strengthen the partnership, MXC is to open a new office in Szechuan.

The partnership is now developing, and MXC is making the right moves! We are excited for this opportunity, and we will soon give more updates on how things unfold.

## MXC files for another patent
MXC already has a lot of patents, securing the use of IoT technology so individuals like you can continue to freely use them well into the future. 

We filed for yet ANOTHER patent – on IoT Accounting and Billing System and Method!

This patent protects MXC’s unique ability to work with IoT devices and the complex machine-to-machine payment mechanism.

Once the news about the patent has spread, the market reacted wildly, going up a [whopping 96% at its peak](https://twitter.com/MXCfoundation/status/1283028996893155329?s=20)!

Whenever the market goes up it is, of course, exciting for all our supporters BUT, I have to say, this is just a small step forward, we all have a LONG way to go and we are determined to become the BIGGEST IoT Token on the planet

## MXC takes on “MXC” in a Trademark Infringement Legal Case
[MXC has launched a trademark infringement legal case against MXC Exchange.](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-legal-action-on-trademark/)
You may have heard of this Chinese exchange that continues to violate our trademark – MXC
At the end of June, we officially launched a legal case against the violator. 

This is done to protect our brand, and MOST IMPORTANTLY to reduce any confusions that many of you have experienced

We are confident as the first and original owners of the “MXC” brand, plus the support we’ve received from [Medium](https://medium.com/), Google and Apple that we will win this case and put an end to this ongoing confusion.

Remember! There’s ONLY 1 MXC and fortunately for you… you’ve already found it!

South Korea is the second largest token market for MXC, and, an important market for the Machine Xchange Coin (MXC), this news will surely be welcome by both MXC supporters and Crypto miners alike.

The M2 Pro Miner gained its notoriety due to it being an easy to operate, low cost miner that has already demonstrated extremely high net returns for miners in China.

Feat. Siwon Kim]]></title><description><![CDATA[We sat down with MXC BD Manager Siwon Kim to discuss the latest developments at MXC and the power of the MXC Community in its making.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-community-deveopment-interview</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-community-deveopment-interview</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>What’s Up at MXC? Feat. Siwon Kim
*This is the original script for the MXC News Update, uploaded on May 18, 2020. It includes an interview featuring Siwon Kim, BD Manager at MXC Foundation.*

Welcome to this week’s MXC News Update!
This week, we want to focus on what the COMMUNITY has been doing with MXC. So let’s get started!

Jeff: Hey Siwon, thanks for joining!

Siwon: Hi Jeff, thanks for having me! 

Jeff: So let’s talk about the MXC Community. How is it looking?

Siwon: I can’t thank everyone enough who supports MXC. Most recently, our YouTube subscription went up to 1500, which is more than TRIPLE the amount we had!

Jeff: What drives people to our YouTube channel?

Siwon: It’s important to note that this growth has been concurrent with our growth on other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. More and more people are finding our content relevant and exciting, while promotions like the $5000 Bitcoin giveaway also spreads the word!

Jeff: That’s great to hear. Would you say that a lot of those who recently found out about MXC are quite new to Blockchain and cryptocurrency?

Siwon: It’s 50-50. Some people are quite new, and I think the fact that people can set up their own LPWAN gateways to earn passive income is the BIG thing. A lot of people these days are looking for creative ways to earn, and MXC is the next best thing. Some people have been in the industry for quite some time, and they’re always astonished by what they see when they find out about us!

Jeff: And I also hear that in the Korean market, MXC is really attracting a lot of new people!

Siwon: Absolutely. The Korean community – although smaller than the Global Community – has been VERY active. We have 2 different types of community – 1 for more official stuff and the other for more casual conversations where people can just hang out. It’s been working out great!

Jeff: So let’s talk about Bitcoin Halving. Now that the Third Halving is complete, what can we expect from the crypto=sphere as a whole, and from MXC?

Siwon: The halving at that moment was rather uneventful at the price around $8600. Yet we are seeing a quick increase as the price of Bitcoin is now tapping the $9500 territory. It overshot the first resistance zone, but let’s see if it can break the second. From MXC, as you know, we have released this awesome M2 PRO Miner that people can use to mine for MXC and other tokens. On top of that, we now have the MXC DATA DASH app available for both iPhone and Android, where people can manage their MXC tokens, staking, miners, gateways, and devices!

Jeff: What makes the M2 Pro Miner and the MXC Data Dash app important?

Siwon: The Miner is MXC’s way of inviting more people to participate. It’s a new way of mining that doesn’t require heavy power. Literally anyone can do it from their own home. The MXC Data Dash App is our way of making the entire process fun and accessible. So both combined, we are opening up the wider world of crypto to EVERYONE, not just the elites or the rich!

Jeff: That’s very exciting! Is there anything else you would like to say to the community?

Siwon: I just want to thank everyone who are the essential part of our movement. I know that we have been through the good and the tough, but we have made it to become the Top 200 token at the moment and all though we still have a LONG way to go. We will continue to work hard with the community’s support, and the name “MXC” will soon be known everywhere! 

Jeff: Great to hear! Once again, thanks for joining, and have a great day!

Siwon: Thanks, Jeff! Stay safe!</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing MXC Mining and Data Dash]]></title><description><![CDATA[We are introducing MXC Mining and the MXC Data Dash Mobile App!

## MXC Welcomes a New Patent

It’s a well-known fact that MXC has quite a few patents under our belt. 
Last week, our newest patent finally arrived in our Berlin HQ. The patent covers firmware upgrades by configuring a low data-rate radio frequency module using high-frequency radio frequency bands.
We are absolutely thrilled about this patent, and will use it to continue developing cutting-edge technologies in Blockchain-IoT!

## Devs Heroes Squash Bugs

With the constant release of new technology, bugs are bound to happen. It’s a part of the development process. Our MXC Dev team has been working around the clock to make sure that all the bugs are resolved, so that you can enjoy a seamless experience when using the MXC Ecosystem – whether it be staking, setting up a Gateway, or using an LPWAN network. 
A big release is coming at the end of the month, so stay tuned!

## Introducing the MXC Miner

As everyone knows, MXC cannot be mined. Rather, MXC tokens can be harvested by deploying an LPWAN network using a Gateway. However, what if you can combine this and mining for other tokens?
With the partnership of MatchX, MXC has developed a miner that allows you to harvest MXC while also mining for other tokens. 
Using LPWAN, this low-electricity miner is cost-efficient and eco-friendly. 
We are giving a sneak peek today, as pre-orders are coming in!

There are a number of opportunities for everyone to get involved in building a data driven future. 

MXC Supernodes are being deployed all around the World! Current supernodes include Huawei Tech, Enlink, and MatchX. You can find the links to these supernodes in the description below. Our dev team is really taking action, with another exciting update on its way.

Last week, we announced a new partnership with Meerkat Company that allows [pets to collect data and generate passive income](https://blog.mxc.org/dog-earn-more-than-you/), and creates a [pet tracker that is operational for 3 months on a single battery charge](https://blog.mxc.org/blockchain-pet-tracking-sensor/).

This week’s news update covers more details, along with [Supernodes application](https://www.mxc.org/l/supernode-apply). The following is an original script of this week’s MXC news update.

California, MXC’s newest partner, and pets with profit. Welcome to this week’s news update!
MXC CEO Sheen Hu was in California last week presenting at the EIT Industry 4.0 Showcase. Throughout the week he also met with MXC community members and enthusiasts in California. 

MXC partnered with Shanghai startup Meerkat, using blockchain to improve pet tracking devices. That’s right, MXC’s blockchain protocol makes it possible for pet tracking sensors to have a battery life of roughly one month.
Now, if you’re familiar with this tech, you’ll know that this is a massive improvement on the 2-4 day average these devices generally have. You can find the exact details on how we do this in the MXC Blog.
With pet sensors on chain, we are also able to provide pet owners with the opportunity to list their pet sensor as a data source in the MXC InterChain Data Market. Your pet may someday help cover the tab of their next bowl of food, visit the vet, or that cute outfit it always wanted to try on.

We are still accepting supernode applicants. If you would like to be an MXC Supernode, click the link in the description and apply. Naturally, all applications must be received before the voting begins.

With MXProtocol, battery life greatly increases.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/blockchain-pet-tracking-sensor</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/blockchain-pet-tracking-sensor</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC increases pet tracker battery life to one month
## MXC Partners with Meerkat to develop pet tracking sensors with significantly longer battery life
MXC is working with Shanghai startup Meerkat to improve the battery life in devices used to track the location of domestic pets. By leveraging MXC’s blockchain protocol, Meerkat is able to increase sensor battery life from four days to one month.


There are numerous GPS tracking solutions for domestic pets, often using 3G or LTE networks to transmit a pet’s location to the owner. While these provide a broad range of service, they suffer from high energy consumption, limiting the battery life of the connected collar to two to four days. While the solution provides peace of mind, it relies on the owner to regularly charge the connected collar, or in some cases replace the battery every few days. Meerkat’s partnership with MXC will allow them to increase battery life to a month while providing a reliable wireless network for their service.

“MXC brings low-power wireless technologies to the forefront,” said Aaron Wagener, Co-Founder of the MXC Foundation. “MXC takes networks, previously limited to an individual, or a single company, and enables a massive publicly owned mesh network ideal for lower power sensors. Pet tracking is just one of the many practical applications MXC is able to help with.”

MXC turns LoRaWAN, a low-power wide-area network, into a viable solution for mobile sensors. This is accomplished by creating a platform LoRAWAN gateway owners can use to connect their gateways.

“When evaluating a project like this, people generally ask one of two questions: why should I trust it? and what do I get in return?” said Wagener. “This is the power of blockchain. With MXProtocol at the core, we’re able to create a fair, automated platform that reliably manages device transactions. We’re also creating an incentive to join the network, that’s where MXC will thrive.”

MXC is a utility token designed for automated payments between wireless devices. If a sensor leaves the service area of the owner’s network, it will search for the nearest MXC enabled network and bid for network access using MXC’s Smart Machine Bidding algorithm. Once an accepted bid has been agreed upon, MXC will be transferred from the sensor’s M2M Wallet to the Wallet of the connected LoraWAN gateway, and the data will be transmitted. 

For Meerkat, this makes it possible for them to leverage LoRaWAN networks beyond their own infrastructure, creating a larger service area for their pet tracking app. As increasingly more companies choose to join the network, the service area will continue to grow.

But with the fun, the play, the kisses, and scratches come the bills.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/dog-earn-more-than-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/dog-earn-more-than-you</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Does this dog earn more than you?
Growing up I had two dogs (Princeton and Socks) and a cat named Muffin. I thought nothing of the cost of the food, vet appointments, or toys. All I cared about was the fun and exciting adventures we had together. In fact, Anthrozoos, a quarterly journal focused on the interactions of people and animals, reported that pet owners were more satisfied with their lives than non-owners. It’s a nice fact, but as an adult, I see pets a little differently.


## Pets cost a lot of money
Your sweet little kitty or happy puppy dog brings a lot of love into your life. But with the fun, the play, the kisses, and scratches come the bills, travel limitations, the unforgiving emergency medical expense and the not so necessary pet pampering. All in all, pets are loving creatures that tend to take a massive chunk of your income.

![Artboard](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/Artboard_cf4bd6a5e6.png)

[CNBC reported in 2017](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/27/how-much-does-it-cost-to-own-a-dog-7-times-more-than-you-expect.html) that the lifetime cost of a cat can reach $30,942 while your favorite fluffy dog may be as expensive as $42,545. While these numbers include everything from kitty litter, to the ongoing costs of food, toys, and grooming, it’s still a pretty hefty amount of money. Consider families with multiple pets like mine. According to these numbers my parents dished out close to $116,032.00 for my furry childhood companions. To put this in perspective, it would take the average salary 2.5 years before tax, and with no other expenses, to pay for these pets. And trust me, these prices come before extra pet self-esteem boosting psychology or implants such as [Neuticles](https://neuticles.com/).

“Some people throw the dog in the car and have him turned into a eunuch because they don’t care,” Mr. Miller said recently. “But there’s a certain segment of pet owners that do care, and that’s where Neuticles come in. And it’s not only canines and felines. We’ve done an elephant, we’ve done prairie dogs. I Neuticled a monkey in Pocahontas, Ark., and a colony of rats for the University of Louisiana,” said Gregg A. Miller, inventor of Neuticles, [as reported by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/style/how-to-pamper-your-pet.html). “Everyday pet owners who opt for Neuticles so their pet will maintain its dignity and self-esteem.”

Apparently, your puppy no longer needs to grow a pair. You can implant them; for a price.

## What if your pets could pick up the tab?
With each passing year, we continue to discover the true value of data. It’s all around us. Helps us identify why people are getting sick and helps us to find cures for illnesses. Data helps citizens motivate governments to reduce air pollution, and data is easy for anybody to collect and resell. It’s so easy, that your favorite furry friend can get involved.

Animals tend to travel. They walk around your apartment, they go outside on walks and experience quite a few different things, types of air, weather patterns and much more. We already have pet trackers. Chips that you put on your pet’s collar to make sure you don’t lose them. These trackers can, quite honestly, do so much more.

## Using data as supplemental income
[MXC is working with Meerkat](https://blog.mxc.org/blockchain-pet-tracking-sensor/) to create a small, inexpensive, low power sensor the size of the average color name tag. This sensor has the potential to track your pet’s location, while at the same time collecting environmental information about their surroundings. If you choose to, you can have this data listed in the MXC Data Market.

If you’re like me, your first thought might be privacy. What does this sensor collect? Will it collect information about me? Absolutely not. The data it collects is strictly location for your pet and environmental information about your surroundings. Then you get to choose whether the data is shared, and specifically which data could be shared. For example, if you want to be sure that nobody knows how dusty your flat is, then you can disable dust reporting.

Data listed in the market can be purchased by scientists around the globe, either as a data set or as a live feed from the sensor (if you wish to allow this). This information could improve pet healthcare, help governments reduce air pollution, it could add to pet safety. Quite honestly, the potential for this data is limitless.

## You and Your Pet, Saving the World 
If your money isn’t enough for you, let’s take a look at the classic big data example.

There’s an elephant in a room with four blind people. One reaches for the trunk and believes they have found a snake. Another goes for the tail. “We have a rope,” she says. The third blind person runs into the side of the elephant. “It’s not a rope, not a snake, it’s a wall!” The fourth hugs a leg “I found a tree!” It’s not until all of them speak together, combine the data, that they can identify that they are in fact in a room with an elephant.

It’s our responsibility to enable the collection of data from as many data points as possible. Until now this was difficult to do, nobody knew where to start. MXC is making it easy for each person to add new, unique data sources, to collect more data about this elephant of a world that we live in.

As more data is collected we will gain a better understanding of our world, and the various effects humanity has on it. I personally want the world to be inhabitable for the generations to follow. More data will help this happen.

You can Start Today 
As the sensors are being developed and tested, there are a number of other ways you can get involved. Join us in our community to talk with other MXC enthusiasts. Share the project with your friends, family, colleagues or even strangers on the street. It’s only by working together that we can make a difference, and that difference starts with you.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How do Supernodes Generate Profit?]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC Supernodes play an essential role in the MXC data trade ecosystem, responsible for ensuring the “Data Highway” remains intact, active and secure.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/how-supernodes-generate-profit</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/how-supernodes-generate-profit</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## How do Supernodes Generate Profit?
[MXC Supernodes](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-supernodes/) play an essential role in the MXC data trade ecosystem, responsible for ensuring the “Data Highway” remains intact, active, secure and a vibrant place for stakers, traders and data sellers.

Supernodes form a central role in the MXC Data Highway. An MXC supernode is a platform that operates using the MXProtocol to network between like-minded peers, thus bringing them all together using the same shared MXProtocol consensus. 

[Apply to be an MXC Supernode](https://www.mxc.org/l/supernode-apply)

MXC Supernodes ensure that all transactions are carried out and completed in a fair, transparent and fast manner. Due to the general nature of the data services operating on the MXProtocol, many supernodes will have a distinct advantage by participating in the MXC supernode system.MXC operates using “LPWAN” or the Low Power Wide Area Network, meaning the processing of transactions will require significantly less computational and processing capacity, this is a major plus point over other systems which demand a vast amount of power and thus a large amount of operating costs.   

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hca3RqaYbVg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hca3RqaYbVg)

Supernodes share in a significant portion of data transfers derived from the operational fee based economy.

Earnings are conveniently paid out on a monthly basis, supernodes are then encouraged to introduce more activity onto their supernode, the higher the activity, the higher the earnings.

The earning breakdown of the entire supernode data revenues is as follows;

10% Return to StakeHolders
10% Token Burn
10% MXC Foundation
70% to SuperNodes
The amount of MXC earned by stakers is governed by the amount of Stake a stakeholder has in an individuals supernode pool. For example the entire staking pool funds are divided into a percent of contribution based on the amount invested by an individual staking party, the percent is obtained by comparing the amount of MXC invested compared with the entire pool of staking investments, this is the percent of the shared stakeholder profit that stakers will receive as a payout in MXC. 

MXC Supernodes play a vital part in the new decentralized data economy, in addition to becoming a key aspect and pillar of support for the data community, supernodes have the ability to earn significant revenues from every data transmission. This is a win for data traders, stakers and the supernodes who power the next generation data highway.

Not only do they earn monthly returns, they get some pretty snazzy MXC perks. Here's how you can get started.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/3-steps-to-mxc-supernode</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/3-steps-to-mxc-supernode</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## 3 Steps to Becoming an MXC Supernode
Becoming an MXC Supernode has a number of benefits. Together Supernodes improve a globally recognized wireless standard, enabling new features largely requested in LoRaWAN communities. This means there is a global, non-crypto related demand for the blockchain-enabled functionality provided by MXC Supernodes. Add staking opportunities, referral rewards, data fees, monthly returns, and MXC Insights to the mix and working as an MXC Supernode Operator becomes a really attractive opportunity. Here’s how to apply to become an MXC Supernode.

## Supernode Responsibilities
Before applying to become an MXC Supernode it is important to understand the obligations of such a role. As we are all aware, with great power comes great responsibility, and being an MXC Supernode is, in this case, no different. MXC Supernodes are expected to undertake the following responsibilities:

•  You must have run your own, or a platform controlled/hosted on a platform such as AWS, or Google Cloud Console or something similar. In addition, it is essential that you offer a monthly uptime of at least 99.99%. This will be reviewed intermittently during your time as an MXC Supernode. For most Supernode candidates, a server running a dual-core, with 4GB of RAM, 20 GB of storage able to send 1000GB per month should be adequate to cope with the data packets being sent via LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network)
•  Commitment, MXC Supernodes are depended upon by potentially thousands of different data suppliers and purchasers. As a result, all Supernodes are expected to take this role seriously, as a result, a minimum of 3 month notification period is required for any Supernode who decides they no longer want to perform as a Supernode
•  In addition to the time commitment, MXC Supernodes must also invest a minimum deposit of 6,000,000 MXC tokens (six million). This is purely a deposit and will be returned to the Supernode at the end of the commitment period. This deposit will also be used in order to ensure that the Supernode follows the responsibilities outlined by MXC. Any deliberate or negligent activity may result in financial penalties    
In addition to the aforementioned responsibilities, there are also some amazing possibilities for Supernodes to begin their entrepreneurial business. Supernodes earn revenue from activities on their Supernode:

•  10% of all revenue goes to MXC – leasing fee 
•  10% of revenue goes to burn
•  10% of revenue after burn goes to Stakers
•  The remaining revenue goes to the Supernode
We have worked hard to ensure that Supernodes efforts match their rewards. As a result, we believe this is a lucrative offer for the right applicant 

## Complete our Online Form
Navigate to [https://www.mxc.org/l/supernode-apply](https://www.mxc.org/l/supernode-apply) and review the information there. Running a supernode has a lot of benefits, but it also holds a lot of responsibility, but with great responsibility comes great rewards. Each successful application will need to run their supernode for a minimum of one year. There will be penalties if a supernode chooses to leave the network early. 

[Apply to be an MXC Supernode](https://www.mxc.org/l/supernode-apply)

It is also important to note that your monthly return as a supernode relies heavily on the number of transactions processed by the supernode. We will provide tools to help you successfully promote your supernode, but it’s important to note that self-promotion is a necessary part of becoming a successful MXC Supernode. 

## What Voters Consider
MXC Supernodes are chosen by MXC holders during a public vote. It is the core responsibility of a Supernode to carry out data network coverage tasks, brand awareness and hold events to attract users to their individual Supernode to attract more data transmissions. These are a few items voters will likely consider when choosing their preferred supernode.

### Reliability
When looking at reliability, voters want to see that there are failover systems in place in the event that a system goes offline. These aren’t difficult to set up, and they ensure that the supernode is able to reliably support LPWAN devices in their country. 

Supernode hosted on a platform such as AWS, or Google Cloud Console offers a monthly uptime of at least 99.99%. This will likely be adequate.

### Carry Out Network Coverage Tasks
MXC Supernodes do not require a lot of processing power or storage in order to maintain reliable service for your country. A server running a dual-core, with 4GB of RAM, 20 GB of storage able to send 1000GB per month should be adequate. 

### Brand awareness and ability to attract users
This is where voters really differentiate the applicants. Setting up and running the MXC Supernode software is only the beginning. You also need the ability to promote your supernode. Why should people use your supernode? How do they hear about you? For those with a substantial following, this will be a benefit to you as an MXC Supernode.

Naturally MXC and MXC Stakers will globally promote the MXC solution, however, it is in the best interest of each supernode operator to localize and promote MXC in their individual countries to increase transactions, thereby increasing both operator and staker returns.

## Let the Voting Begin
MXC Supernodes are chosen in a voting process. Successful applicants will be listed, and the MXC holding community will vote for the preferred supernode. To vote, community members will deposit MXC towards their favorite supernode. If that supernode wins the voting process, then the votes will be deposited as stakes in the winning supernode. 

We’ll keep you informed on the process. You can learn more about MXC Supernodes by reading the [supernodes article written by our co-founder Aaron Wagener](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-supernodes/).

Berlin is a bustling global blockchain hub with numerous blockchain projects stationed throughout the city. [Berlin Blockchain Week](https://www.blockchainweek.berlin/) had 100 official events with large players such as [Huobi Global](https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/) holding private events throughout the city. So when it comes to planning a successful Berlin Blockchain Week event, the heat was definitely on. How did we do? 

## Blockchain IoT Summit
On Wednesday, MXC hosted the Blockchain and IoT Summit with [IoTex](https://www.iotex.io/). 175 people registered for the event, resulting in 57 attendees joining us to discover how blockchain plays a pivotal role in the further development of IoT.
![MG_1781](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MG_1781_8bde8412e1.png)

After presentations from MXC and IoTex, the main attraction of the evening was the expert panel discussion filled with global blockchain influencers, and key players in the blockchain industry.

“Nobody gives a f*** about their data, and they should give a f***.” — Michael Nye, [@MrMichaelNye](https://twitter.com/MrMichaelNye)
![MG_1814](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MG_1814_291be3e709.jpeg)

During the panel we had a heated discussion about data. Michael Nye was adamant that people need to take a closer look at how their data is being used. Members of the audience were interested in the concept of monetizing their personal data. MXC Co-Founder Aaron Wagener questioned whether one person’s data holds enough monetary value to be purchased on a person-by-person basis. 

“Our individual data has very little intrinsic value as a “singular” commodity, so our focus as individuals should be on controlling your data and knowing and allowing who has access to it, not a question of monetization.” — Aaron Wagener, [@aaron_wagener](https://twitter.com/aaron_wagener)

This spurred another discussion lead by Etiënne vantKruys, [@hettalentctc](https://twitter.com/hettalentctc), on whether the benefits we receive from companies such as Google or Facebook, outweigh the loss or their use of our personal data. He lead this discussion by asking the audience how many of them actually wanted to take full control of their data.

By the end of the evening, both the panelists and audience members worked up a great appetite, finishing 50 pizzas and drinking 73 bottles of beer. An excellent warm–up for the MXC event scheduled the next day. 
![MG_1846](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MG_1846_f3befb1122.jpeg)

## Exclusive Block Party
Our exclusive Block Party on Thursday was a massive success! We filled each of the 105 available spaces for the event, with an on-site waiting list of 47 people hoping to make it in before we closed the doors.
![MG_2025](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MG_2025_cec2255893.jpeg)

During the course of the evening, we enjoyed presentations from [MXC](https://www.mxc.org/), [Quarkchain](https://quarkchain.io/), and [IOSG Venture](http://www.iosg.vc/#/), followed by a lively celebration of blockchain filled with conversations spoken to the rhythm of the event DJ.

Trains, Supernode Demo and a party. Welcome to this week’s news update! 

On Tuesday we released our second MVP, managing foot traffic in public spaces. For this MVP brought MXProtocol to train stations. Measuring the number of people traveling through stations provides important information on whether a train station should continue to receive service and the value of advertising opportunities in that station. 

Thursday brought us the first MXC Demo as we gave you [your first access to our LPWAN sensor and gateway management platform](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-m2m-data-demo/). In this demo you can see how to manage MXProtocol enabled hardware, determine their bidding strategies, and top up or withdraw MXC from their M2M Wallets. You can access the demo by going to the link in the description below. The username is build@mxc.org, with the password thefutureismxc.

Berlin Blockchain week is upon us! Our Block Party is in such high demand (we actually have a waiting list), that we decided to host a second event the night before. We’re also bringing our band of influencers and investors with us, and we’ll give away two tickets to the block party. Yes these are the LAST TWO TICKETS to Berlin Blockchain Week’s most exclusive event. You won’t want to miss it, so join us on Wednesday evening for our IoT Blockchain Summit.

This has been this week’s news update. I look forward to speaking with all of you again next week. Until then, get active, get in the community, ask us questions — because it’s only together that we can build the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[It's Your Turn: Explore the Live MXC M2M Data Demo]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-m2m-data-demo</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-m2m-data-demo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## It’s Your Turn: Explore the Live MXC M2M Data Demo
Today we’re providing both our community and integration partners with an exclusive first glimpse of MXC’s M2M device management system. With this demo you can login into the system, interact with and get a explore the device management platform and MXC M2M Wallet. This device management platform is designed for LPWAN hardware owners and operators.

## Overview
The MXC demo consists of two systems essential to the inter-chain data network: the machine-to-machine payments mechanism, and a LoRaWAN server designed to manage every LPWAN gateway on the planet. With the demo credentials, participants and community members are able to login to the portal and discover the simplicity of MXC’s solution.

MXC’s LoRa server provides an easy interface for users to manage their MXC enabled LPWAN devices. By registering an MXC enabled LPWAN gateway in the portal, users can manage the device, configure how it will interact with third-party sensors, and instinctively set the smart machine bidding requirements for each individual gateway. 

When users manage their LPWAN sensors on the platform, they gain a unique advantage, allowing them the opportunity to visualize the collected data, organize them by application (air quality, soil moisture etc.) and determine the smart machine bidding strategies the sensors will use to ensure connectivity while roaming. In this sense, MXC is not only providing a revolutionary way to ensure that each user is able to easily manage and resell the collected data, but it also provides **the world’s first LoRaWAN global sensor roaming solution**. 

MXC’s M2M Wallet shows how users can top-up their MXC M2M Wallets and use the token of their choice to transmit device data through third-party LoRaWAN gateways, or alternatively to pay for a live stream of data from a third-party LoRaWAN sensor. 

Users earning MXC by hosting an LPWAN network will have the ability to withdraw their earnings from their M2M Wallet. At this time the payments mechanism is running on the Ropsten Ethereum Test-net, and each public user will have the ability to interact with the M2M Wallet and payments mechanism. 

## Tutorial: how to work with the MXC Live Demo
Logging into the demo is quick and simple. Navigate to [https://lora.demo.cloud.mxc.org/](https://lora.demo.cloud.mxc.org/) and enter:

User: build@mxc.org
Password: thefutureismxc

**Please note: as these credentials are public, it is very possible that another user is currently reviewing the demo using the same credentials as you. If you notice this, feel free to switch to a different user. **

Once you login, you can decide whether you want to manage your LPWAN devices, or work with the MXC M2M Wallet. 

## LoRaWAN Server + Blockchain = Life Changing Innovation
In the LPWAN device management section, you can create multiple organizations. Organizations provide an easy way to manage devices owned by multiple parties through one account. This is ideal for companies or governments who choose to outsource their IT management to another company. 
![1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/1_03c5b41cf9.png)

Within an organization you can register multiple user accounts with varying permissions. For example, if someone needs access to review the data collected by a specific sensor, a user can be created with specific permissions that limit their access for this purpose.

Organization users can also request access by attempting to create an account. Admins must approve their request before access will be granted to that user. 

Within the organization, multiple LPWAN gateways can be registered. Here you can mark the location of the device, and note the current status of that device. 
![2222](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/2222_a01b1337a8.png)

Each organization can run multiple “applications” or groups of sensors collecting data for a specific purpose. For example, a single application can group sensors managing the watering and fertilizing of plants on a farm. This helps to ensure that sensors geared towards a specific use case remain together, instead of being listed in a jumbled mess on the server. 
![3](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/3_7c8f8c1a57.png)

## MXC M2M Payments Mechanism 
This demo release is limited to the M2M Wallet provided for the management of the MXC token a user dedicates for machine-to-machine transactions. 

Here users can easily top-up their M2M Wallet. 
![4](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/4_66a0a2e4ec.png)

Withdraw token from their M2M Wallet to the AXS Wallet of their choosing. 
![5](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/5_92fc8c2a57.png)

And see an overview of the M2M transactions their MXC was either used for, or the M2M transactions that earned them MXC.

We’re excited to announce that the global IoT phenomenon MXC is live on Bithumb! After our [successful launch on Bithumb Global](https://blog.mxc.org/bithumb-lists-mxc/), Bithumb couldn’t wait to add the MXC  token, driving the world of data and blockchain implementation across the globe on their digital asset exchange.

“We’re delighted and humbled by both the speed at which Bithumb decided to adopt MXC, and in addition, the strong enthusiasm the international market has shown for MXC, a token that provides true blockchain integration,” said [Aaron Wagener](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-wagener-0424821/), Co-Founder and COO at the MXC Foundation. “We are thrilled that MXC has received such excitement within the Korean market. It just goes to show that that MXC is an unstoppable movement, set to change the world of blockchain and data.”

After opening their world trading system in 2014, [Bithumb](https://www.bithumb.com/) quickly grew to be the most popular digital asset exchange in Korea; boasting a daily trading volume of over 702 million USD. Throughout their history, Bithumb demonstrated a strong focus on customer service by opening four physical customer service offices throughout Korea. 

“Bithumb’s enthusiasm to add the MXC token to their platform is quite overwhelming,” said [Sheen Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheenhu/), Co-Founder and CEO at the MXC Foundation. “When established companies like Bithumb list MXC on their platform with such gusto and enthusiasm, it really demonstrates that the message is getting out there. MXC is here to stay, and we’re changing the world of connectivity and M2M payments.”

The MXC Foundation’s token “MXC” is a utility token, designed to be used for automated payments between IoT devices. As the adoption of MXC’s Smart City Standard, the MXProtocol, continues around the globe, communities will benefit from more reliable wireless connectivity, whilst companies and governments benefit by reducing the cost of both deployment and operation of smart city technologies. 

MXC is available on Bithumb immediately. For more information about MXC, and how to get involved in the MXC movement, join the [MXC telegram group](https://t.me/mxcfoundation) or visit the [MXC Website](https://www.mxc.org/).

## The MXC Foundation recently hired Luke Schoen, a renowned blockchain developer who formerly worked on Polkadot at Parity
MXC’s latest hire reviewed the Ethereum white paper with Stephan Tual in August, 2014. His experience brought him to experiment on various blockchain projects, including DEXs, and his most recent experience at Parity demonstrated his ability to develop intuitive parachain wallets with a dynamic user interface. Luke Schoen has years of experience working on blockchain projects, and now he’s now focusing on a project with the potential to change the world. 

“Now that I have the groundwork covered, I want to make an impact,” said Luke Schoen, Senior Blockchain Developer at MXC. “MXC is giving the power back to the people, making the world fairer for everyone, and giving blockchain a real chance.”

Schoen’s interest in technology began as a child, watching his father work with CAD software. His technical journey started as a 3D designer for video games. From this he continued learning various programming languages, before starting his work with blockchain and working as an Ethereum DApp developer. 

Schoen will start his work at MXC by bolstering the AXS Wallet and M2M Wallet, preparing them for mainstream global deployment. While working with this, he wants to bring more developers into the MXC Community to get them excited, and contributing to MXC’s open source development of the MXProtocol. 

“MXC has already achieved a number of impressive milestones,” said Schoen. “There are opportunities to expand the number of developers building on MXC’s open source protocol. The idea is to build different channels for them to participate in.”

Introducing the most progressive step in the burgeoning global data economy. A step that is set to reform the data transmission market and significantly increase token / data transaction speeds. Welcome to the new world of data, welcome to MXC Supernodes.

With a clearly defined initiative, MXC Supernodes focus on distributing and decentralizing data automation thus thrusting the MXProtocol and holders of the MXC IoT Token onto the global data stage.

## What is an MXC Supernode?

https://youtu.be/NIjGkT4ofTw?list=PLvLnMNCAAzGJ7-txJVsfvOmWI1-65a7Kl

MXC Supernodes are the engines or “hosts” behind decentralized data platforms powering data transfers and transmissions. Each supernode is a LoRaWAN server, equipped with the MXC Machine-to-Machine “M2M” Wallet.

Initially, MXC will roll-out with 21 supernodes globally, the idea is to place the supernodes geographically separate from each other, in order to facilitate the massive global demand; Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Supernodes will be chosen based on their reliability, their ability to carry out the data network coverage tasks, their brand awareness and ability to attract more users to their individual supernode.
![mxc-supernodes-2](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/mxc-supernodes-2_37154de7d0.png)

Supernodes support the continuous flow of data by acting as a relay between sensors and their owners. At no time will an MXC Supernode store any data. *All* data sent through the supernodes are end-to-end encrypted, meaning your data belongs to you, always.

Each MXC Supernode works, as a silo, generating income from the associated fees generated from the data transaction processed by the supernode. Therefore it is in a supernode’s best interest to motivate a wider variety of users to send more data on their supernode platform.

## An Inclusive Data Process
The MXC Foundation is committed to data decentralization. This decentralization process allows as many people as possible to benefit from the processes we implement at MXC:

***Supernodes***; generate income based on the number of transactions processed on their supernode. This also encourages supernode operators to hold more events and promotions to encourage users to use their individual supernode platform
Each supernode is, in a sense, their own exchange, they charge a small transaction fee resulting in revenue/income for the supernode, this increases [staking in the MXC token](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-staking-mechanism-explained/)

***Data Users***; By depositing MXC into the supernode it allows data users and data purchasers to use the global IoT network built for and by its users. Furthermore, the more an individual invests into the supernode, the more they stand to profit.
At the close of a calendar quarter, supernodes share profits generated from the fees associated with the data transmissions, 10% of the total fees will be shared with the supernode’s wider community
MXC offers a shared capital arrangement where the more MXC an investor places on the supernode of their choice, the more they stand to earn as part of the allocation/investment process
![mxc-supernodes-3](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/mxc-supernodes-3_4aa9509052.png)

***MXC Data***; MXC’s supernode model significantly assists data growth. By starting with 21 supernodes, MXC gains 21 global supporters promoting data processing in their specific regions. This gives the MXC Foundation a global reach, making MXC a truly global IoT economy.
## Contour Payments, Extinguishing Blockchain TPS
One of the biggest issues in regards to IoT tokens is the inability to make fast Blockchain transactions within a matter of seconds. Introducing MXC Contour Payments. With Contour Payments, IoT transactions will happen in less than 4 seconds.
![mxc-supernodes-4](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/mxc-supernodes-4_2364d91e0e.png)

## MXC, making Lightning Fast Transactions Happen! 
Contour Payments are taken and delivered from one M2M wallet to another M2M wallet. Generally, the movement of a token from one wallet to another takes quite some time due to a number of latency factors. Contour Payments extinguishes this by leveraging the SuperNode transaction processes.

Contour Payments function similarly to how tokens are transferred on a crypto exchange; although the ledger registers the increase/decrease of your token transfer, the actual token is secured by a 3rd party until either party decides to completely withdraw their tokens. This is how token purchasing functions on exchanges such as Binance or Bithumb. By performing M2M transactions in this manner, MXC allows for extremely fast payment transactions without delay and without affecting any ledger balances.

Contour Payments are the future of data transactions and the solution to instant IoT and data payments. This is the new world of MXC and IoT tokenization.

**Supernodes Increase Data Market Relevance**

MXC Supernode partners will benefit from the [MXC Foundation’s unique staking model](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-staking-mechanism-explained/). By becoming an MXC Super Node these exclusive partners have the ability to:

- Attract more Gateway Owners to list with MXC Supernodes
- This will promote further usage of the MXProtocol and continued Token liquidity
- Earning &amp; Burning
- As the exclusive supernode partners continue to profit from hosting, it’s also essential that MXC ensures the power isn’t concentrated exclusively to these supernodes
- As a result, MXC introduces an earn and burn technique, this means, 20% of all earned token by the supernodes will be either burnt or pushed back into the data economy as an air-drop.
- The break-down is as follows, 10% of all revenue from the supernodes will be burnt and a further 10% will be put in an airdrop pool giving back exclusively to M2M wallet holders
- The individual amount earned by each M2M Wallet holder via the air-drop depends on specific key factors:
- How much MXC is held within the M2M wallet
- How active the user has been within the data market
- The number of transactions, transmissions triggered by the M2M holder throughout the process
- These airdrops and burns will happen at intervals of one time per year
- Geo-Overlaps
- Staking allows for the even distribution of supernodes and ensures that there are no Geo-Overlaps
- Supernodes will be chosen based on their geo availability to ensure heavily occupied data networks are served more efficiently than those with less requirements
- Governance of the network
- By attracting more sensors and gateways to generate data, supernodes represent Stakers in their network for the future development of the MXProtocol
- Supernodes can be better managed and improved by continually attracting more Stakers.
![mxc-supernodes-5](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/mxc-supernodes-5_f95da09813.png)

MXC Supernodes are set to transform data transmissions and the geographic data scene on a global level. They do this by improving participation within the data market which is the key to increasing usage and spreading further understanding of the MXC movement. The supernodes are effectively decentralized IoT network operators, solid partners who offer fast, scalable M2M payments and data exchanges for the wider public.

The supernode process will continue to grow over the coming months, and years as MXC continues to move forward as the largest and most trusted IoT economy across the globe.

The Future of IoT, is MXC</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bithumb Global Lists Global IoT Token, MXC]]></title><description><![CDATA[Korea's largest crypto exchange, Bithumb, lists the MXC Foundations revolutionary Blockchain Token “MXC” on the Bithumb Global exchange.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/bithumb-lists-mxc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/bithumb-lists-mxc</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Bithumb Global Lists Global IoT Token, MXC
## Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Bithumb, lists the MXC Foundations revolutionary Blockchain Token “MXC” on the Bithumb Global exchange.
The Berlin-based internet of things Token, “MXC” has officially launched on their 7th Exchange, opening up a massive Global market via the esteemed Bithumb Global Exchange. 

“The entire MXC team is both thrilled and humbled by this recognition from such a globally renowned and trusted partner as Bithumb, this is a true honor,” said MXC Co-Founder [Aaron Wagener(https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-wagener-0424821/). “MXC has always viewed the thriving Korean market with great wonder. We are quite conscious of the entrepreneurial spirit of the Korean people and their keen technological interest, we believe this is a perfect fit that will see the MXC brand grow from strength to strength together with the people of Korea.”

After initially declaring their interest in the key market of China, MXC has now clearly mapped out their next ambitious step, Korea; a country that already boasts some of the highest token participation rates in the world with an impressive enthusiasm for Blockchain, IoT and Tokenization.

 “The MXC Foundation believes that the path to global IoT Token domination is via the ‘Tiger of Asia,’ Korea,” said Wagener. 

From the very outset, MXC received a lot of keen interest from investors early on, [listing in their first, Top 10  Exchange, Huobi](https://blog.mxc.org/huobi-global-mxc-iot-token/). Shortly thereafter MXC delivered again with another impressive move, listing on Crypto big hitters including, Gate and BiBox.  

Since inception, the MXC token has always taken a rather unconventional approach to the industry, offering a stark contrast to other crypto tokens currently available. The key difference for MXC and their supporters is that MXC is strictly focusing on longevity via real Blockchain [implementation and integration](https://blog.mxc.org/mxc-government-deal-shanghai/). As a Foundation, MXC has continued its focus on achieving sustainable growth in a token market that is, in many ways, seeking moral responsibility. The MXC Foundation believes this can be achieved by implementing Blockchain solutions which truly solve real-world issues. 

“Our goal is to take data and turn it into tangible information, information that affects people’s day to day lives, ultimately improving the quality of life for the many, not just the few”, said Wagener.

With this latest listing on Bithumb Global, the intention of the MXC Foundation is clear, with a continual roll out of their IoT Standard and Blockchain Data solutions from Berlin, to the world. </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[$12 Million Dollars, Staking, and Whitepaper]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/12-million-dollars-staking-and-whitepaper</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/12-million-dollars-staking-and-whitepaper</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## $12 Million Dollars, Staking, and Whitepaper

Now, we’re excited to introduce the next step, releasing the world’s first “Data Senate”, known as MXC Staking. MXC Staking increases participation in the data world while bringing multiple tangible aspects to the IoT Blockchain Industry. As part of the MXC movement we are convinced that Staking will change, decentralize and significantly improve participation in the data world for everyone, for generations to come.

At MXC we’re using our exclusive Blockchain technology to increase IoT data efficiency, monetize data downlinks, improve data transparency and increase device data accumulation responsibility. Now, with the introduction of MXC Staking, we allow MXC holders to play an active role in the direction of future tech rollouts, including the design of the Global IoT Standard, the MXProtocol and additionally allowing investors to significantly generate passive income along the way. 

MXC Staking, for the first time, brings in a tangible aspect to the IoT Blockchain industry. Staking promotes and enhances the amount of data transactions and transmissions by giving all involved participants a fair stake in the process, this is truly a market powered by machines and built by people, for people. 

## The High-Stake Benefits
There are a lot of benefits to the Staking mechanism MXC has introduced. Firstly, Staking increases the democratization of data. At MXC, we’ve chosen Staking to ensure that those invested and active in the MXC movement have a fair say in its future. This provides both investors and the community with an opportunity to direct and guide future developments. To do this, staking allocates influential “voting” rights. By voting, active MXC holders guide how the MXC Foundation tackles new opportunities within the data world. 
![MXC-Staking-2](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-Staking-2_44cb64d4a7.png)

Staking also increases MXC holders earning potential, meaning, the larger the portion of MXC, the larger staking rights one would have, the larger say in the direction of the Protocol and the larger the potential earnings.

Stake earnings occur once an MXC holder deposits and allocates their MXC to a specific Supernode, then, the more MXC that specifically elected SuperNode earns (by processing more data) the more the Staking participant earns. 

In some areas you will notice that the MXC Staking model follows the similar and well known Proof of Stake “PoS” concept, however it differs in the sense that MXC can not be mined, so to combat this, MXC developed a revolutionary “Sharing Economy”. This Sharing Economy allows LPWAN Gateway owners to harvest MXC by sharing their LPWAN publicly. 

MXC Staking allows holders of MXC token, be it either traditional token purchasers, data traders or SuperNodes who accumulate MXC, to have a larger stake in the entire direction and usage of MXC SuperNode networks.

## Participation
Participation in the Staking concept is simple. Before you begin,  you’ll need to own MXC. You can buy MXC at one of the many exchanges supporting MXC, for more information on the available exchanges simply visit: [www.mxc.org/get-mxc](www.mxc.org/get-mxc)

## Once you have your MXC:
- **Choose one of twenty-one MXC Supernodes**
Choose and safely deposit your MXC in one of the twenty-one Globally Distributed supernodes. As your chosen supernode processes more data, the earning potential of the supernode increases. The more MXC stored on a supernode, the higher the potential return for the investors.
- **Enjoy your return each quarter**
At the end of each quarter, the staker receives a dividend based on the amount of MXC the supernode has generated. This payout is based on how much “stake” or invested MXC the investor has in the specific supernode.
Each investor has full control as to which MXC Supernode they choose to store their MXC in. Naturally, the more active a supernode is, the higher the potential payout. Therefore it is important that investors review the potential of each supernode. Alternatively, an investor can also hedge their investments, and invest in multiple supernodes.
![MXC-Staking-3](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-Staking-3_d1d726f32f.png)

Once the end of the Quarterly allocated period has been completed, the Staker then receives a dividend based on the amount of MXC the Supernode has generated, the payout is also calculated based on how much “Stake” or invested MXC the investor has in that specific Supernode. The choice is completely up to the investor as to which Supernode they choose to store their MXC, the more active a SuperNode is, the higher the potential payout, so it is also important that investors choose wisely, alternatively they can also choose to hedge their investments and invest in multiple

## Supernodes &amp; Contour Payments
Data traders will need to upload MXC to their M2M wallet, these M2M wallets are largely operated by a chosen Supernode. The Supernode acts as an Escrow for individuals data trade payments. 

## Why do Supernodes hold payments?
MXC is significantly increasing transaction speeds, to do this we’ve installed a mechanism called “Contour Payments” what this means is, when you upload your MXC to an M2M wallet the MXC is held by your allocated Supernode, the Supernode then allocates the exact equivalent of MXC as a “Contour Payment” this Contour Payment method then allows you to trade MXC within a matter of seconds. 

Once you have completed your M2M data trading and you wish to withdraw your MXC from your M2M wallet, the Supernode will then reallocate the remainder of MXC you have as per your smart contract, this reallocation process will generally take a maximum of a few hours to complete. 

## Unique on the Global Data Market
With the introduction of Staking, MXC Supernodes have introduced a unique data movement, we’ve designed an IoT Device Data Network  that allows literally anyone to build out their own Global IoT Network, this is decentralization at work. The staking system promotes more devices to share more device data, thus allowing for all parties to reap the rewards of an active and bustling Supernode.
![MXC-Staking-4](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-Staking-4_fa483f704c.png)

Additionally, MXC makes data acquisition “tangible” as part of the implemented MXC network design, encouraging active users on the Supernode. The more active sensors operating on a Supernode results in more transmissions and transactions, thus MXC Staking encourages Supernodes to become more active themselves and promote regional and international usage. 

The power behind the MXC Supernodes is highlighted by the fact that at all levels they’re encouraging increased data flows and increased data traffic. In a sense it comes down to pure data activity, the more active the machine to machine communication is in the Supernodes the more MXC users actively profit. 

Furthermore, MXC Supernodes, who are made up of data specialists and international brands have the ability to further encourage more people to get involved, making the global Supernodes grow exponentially. 

This process allows for MXC holders to not only further participate in building the global IoT network, but also allows for their MXC token holdings to significantly grow over time.  

At MXC we believe that with the introduction of Supernodes, along with the introduction of the MXC Staking model, MXC is increasing the validity of a truly decentralised data market, one which more investors and active participants can profit from as being active members of the data market.

This is the new world of machine to machine communication, of data economies and of democratised data, this is MXC, the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC to Donate Millions for Clean Air]]></title><description><![CDATA[As many Governments continue to deny and delay progress on global climate change, MXC, has chosen to take a disruptive course of action.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-to-donate-millions-for-clean-air</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-to-donate-millions-for-clean-air</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC to Donate Millions for Clean Air
*As many Governments continue to deny and delay progress on global climate change, the German-based IoT Token, MXC, has chosen to take a disruptive course of action. Developing a world-first environmental program, MXC is set to significantly reward participants for actively contributing to clean air *

When it comes to causes of premature death, the risks posed by global air pollution are now only exceeded by behavioural and metabolic factors. Furthermore, air pollution and poor access to quality air is the number one leading environmental risk factor, far surpassing other environmental risks that have too often been the primary focus of public health measures in the past, such as polluted and unsafe water or poor sanitation *[World Health Organization’s (WHO) report: “State of Global Air/2019”]*. With deaths caused by air pollution slowly on the rise, it is the Global IoT Token “MXC” and our committed supporters, who have decided to take measurable action, taking a significant step towards engaging communities, businesses, and citizens in order to reclaim their cities and reclaim their health.

## Air Pollution: the Silent Killer
In 2017 the World Health Organization identified air pollution as one of the highest mortality risk factors globally, “associated with about 4.9 million deaths and 147 million years of healthy life lost”. Despite the publication of these staggering figures, little to no progress has been made and, in many cities, small particle air precipitation based on quantified air fragment readings has continued to significantly increase.
![MXC-to-Donate-Millions-for-Clean-Air1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-to-Donate-Millions-for-Clean-Air1_5999162240.png)

The 2018 World Health Organization study pinpointed direct links between air pollution and the current environmental disaster facing humanity: *“Air pollution exposure is linked with increased hospitalizations, disability, and early death from respiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and diabetes, as well as communicable diseases like pneumonia”* all of this is leading to a truly global epidemic of monumental proportions.

The time has come to not only recognise the deteriorating situation that we as human beings have created, more importantly, the time has also come for a real solution. I’ve always been a believer that as individuals we can not only make a meaningful difference for ourselves, moreover, it is our obligation to make a purposeful difference for the better, leaving this planet in a better state than how we experienced it. Now, as Founder of the MXC Foundation, I believe we can turn this action into a movement. We’re determined to reverse this horrifying silent killer facing our current existence and the continued and ever-worsening air pollution crisis that our, and future generations will face.

## MXC Particle Depletion Program
I am both excited and personally proud to announce the *MXC Particle Depletion Program (PDP)*. The MXC PDP is a global first, set to drastically revolutionise the way society approaches air quality and the absolute catastrophic epidemic facing public health in society today. The MXC goal for the “PDP” is to ensure current and future generations live in a cleaner, low-risk environment, extending both the length and quality of citizens lives.  

The most harmful toxins have been narrowed to a specific measure of key elements, which, primarily make up the offending minuscule elements occupying our air, being ingested into the human nervous system. The *MXC Particle Depletion Program (PDP)*, has identified the biggest contributors towards deteriorating human health, and, as a direct result, will focus on sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) all of which will be targeted throughout this ambitious program.

The *Particle Depletion Program (PDP)* will leverage the MXProtocol to allow data to be sent, allocated, and measured over extreme distances. Data transmitted using MXProtocol devices can be easily compiled an analysed with data collected from additional sources. This will provide a complete picture of how effective ongoing efforts to reduce air pollution actually are.
![MXC-to-Donate-Millions-for-Clean-Air-1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-to-Donate-Millions-for-Clean-Air-1_b75812f2f6.png)

As part of the *MXC Particle Depletion Program (PDP)*, MXC has chosen to take focus on the macro, making the program inclusive, this bold initiative rewards both members of society for reducing air pollution, and the biggest contributors to air pollution for greatly reducing the amount of pollution they produce. The PDP brings all sides together in order to solve the issue affecting everyone, in a truly united effort. The MXC PDP will financially reward individuals, businesses and governments by tokenising active monitoring of their air pollution particle precipitation levels and for taking active measures to significantly, and continually, reduce on an ongoing basis. The MXC Foundation is set to financially support those who drastically reduce their global footprint. Additionally, governments will also be rewarded for the introduction of policies based on the qualifiable incoming data provided by LPWAN air quality sensors, funded by the MXC Foundation.  

One of the most exciting elements of the MXC PDP is not only that it attempts to solve real-world issues facing humanity, but it does so using a comprehensive all-inclusive approach. Often many smaller parties get left out of the environmental impact on change, and more often than not they are the ones directly affected by the new environmental changes. MXC changes this approach allowing citizens to get involved.

## Every one can Change their World
By setting up a cheap air quality sensor (under $10USD) and attaching it to the MXProtocol citizens can automatically become part of the environmental solution. The sensors, set up by citizens, transmit this air quality data directly to the MXC Data Market in order for the data to be identified and qualified. By doing this, citizens are directly involved in reporting air quality to ensure a continued and constant data stream accumulation, the transmissions from other sources, including businesses are then also directly measured in comparison to these measurements to add an increased element of control. In turn, MXC financially rewards citizens to get involved and take part in one of the largest environmental control projects ever undertaken on the Blockchain.
![44](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/44_bedd294aa1.jpeg)

Businesses are rewarded for reporting their current air quality levels and subsequently rewarded once they have achieved set-goals, the MXC Machine-to-Machine wallet automatically allocates MXC to the businesses Blockchain wallets the very moment the air quality they are detecting falls to targeted levels.    

MXC is determined to make a difference to all parties involved, investing millions of MXC to participants, resulting in a healthy society, increased air quality, improved cooperation between the business sector and society, as well as making wealthy participants along the way.

As our MXC Blockchain movement continues to spread across the globe we must first act as responsible global citizens. At MXC we’re determined to make an impact, an impact for what is *right* and a movement for good. MXC was designed as a decentralized Blockchain movement *for* the people by people.

This is the future of data, the data highway, designed to give back to communities. It’s time to contribute to the greater good, and at MXC, we’re ready to serve one, serve all.

The world’s urbanisation has been rapid, and dramatic. Between the years 1800 and 200, the percentage of the world’s population of people living in urban areas increased from two percent to 47 percent. 

According to the United Nations’ ‘[World Urbanisation Prospects](https://population.un.org/wup/)‘ report, that number will increase to 75 percent by 2050.

Pinpointing the exact reasons are difficult, but the UN links economic growth, infrastructure, resources, industrialisation and more advanced employment prospects to the rapid rate of growth.

Regulating the surging growth of cities is no small task. Cities are almost living beasts, that are surprisingly complex. Providing better services to these metropolises with a better understanding of what is happening in the city requires granular data. This, in turn, can make cities more livable, efficient, and environmentally friendly. Early Internet of Things sensors and ideas are already in place, but there are challenges to being able to turn monitoring into understanding.

Here are six smart cities working on building a better life for citizens using clever, useful, innovative ideas, along with a look at how MXC’s non-profit approach may be able to make better use of data and data sharing – and the first city involved with MXC’s solutions, Shanghai.

## Barcelona
The second biggest city in Spain is one of the world’s great tourist destinations, from La Rambla to La Sagrada Família.

Here’s a sample of Barcelona’s smart city infrastructure, and the challenges they face.

Smart street lighting, from the transition of [1,100 old lamposts to LED street lights](https://population.un.org/wup/) reduce energy consumption for over 50 streets. Sensors brighten lights only when cars, bicycles, and pedestrians are in close proximity, with automatic dimming to conserve energy. Street lighting is also turned on purposefully by the city to highlight and attract people to events. Each street light provides free WiFi, with additional sensors collecting data on air quality. [The data is both published publicly](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/), with multiple-language support, and stored by city.
![BARCELONA](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/BARCELONA_78afe96bec.png)

Barcelona’s transportation system is also well advanced, with bull shelters digitised to provide free WiFi, USB charging stations, and provide bus arrival times, with apps for riders to learn or find information about the city. Parking spaces, which have not always been easily come-by, have sensors embedded into the ground to detect the presence of a vehicle. With the help of an app ‘ApparkB’, drivers are directed to free spaces, with parking fees paid for through the app as well. Within one year, the city of Barcelona was helping drivers to 4,000 car parks, and collecting fees more sustainably.

Other useful IoT features include smart waste bins in the city, which monitors the rising amount of garbage and prompt for collection via smart routes. The need to conserve valuable water, in a particular part of the world, was also realised. IoT sensors are used to monitor rain and humidity, along with water levels in public fountains, which allows staff to better determine irrigation, and allows for remote control of electrovalves to deliver water only when and where is necessary.

City Hall proceeded with data collection via a proprietary platform known as [Sentilo](https://www.sentilo.io/wordpress/), which was later made open source for other cities to use. The issue for Barcelona is not data collection, but the capacity to use data beyond silos of information that can better help the city understand its population and make better decisions about infrastructure spending.

The next significant iteration for Barcelona should work to achieve those goals, and make the city’s infrastructure both simpler and better. The city could seek to use an open-source sensor network, with data shared on a common standard. Data protections, better creating anonymity and protection of personal data, along with access to the anonymized public data, are also essential.

## Columbus, Ohio
Columbus, in the northern state of Ohio in the US, won $40m via the US Department of Transportation’s Smart City Challenge, with a supplement of up to $10 million from Paul G. Allen’s Vulcan Inc, back in 2016.

These funds were awarded to Columbus to allow the city to continue with a grand plan to broadly improve the quality of life within the city, drive economic growth including in logistics, provide better access to jobs and opportunity, and foster sustainability.

The city won the funding, to go with $90m already committed by 60 private partners, to install up to six electric self-driving shuttles in order to link a new bus rapid transit center to a retail district in the city. 

Since then, the city has advanced its plans to become a leader in the US in many facets: remaking public transit through connected bus, shuttle, cars, and traffic lights known as CCTN, accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) through wide availability of charging points and infrastructure, and has explored the possibilities for autonomous vehicles. 3,000 sensors were placed in vehicles and at 175 intersections to monitor traffic patterns and safety via the CCTN.
![COLUMBUS](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/COLUMBUS_a7b7931d61.png)

Other initiatives, focused on nine major projects, include Event Parking Management in two suburbs to guide drivers to parks more efficiently, Smart Mobility Hubs offering pick-ups and drop-offs for multiple modes of transport, plus free WiFi and trip planning kiosks, and the Smart Columbus Operating System, an Open Data Platform that provides anytime access to the city’s latest mobility data. In addition, a single app is planned that would allow residents to pay for all modes of transportation – from catching public transport to paying for parking, along with car-sharing and bike-sharing.

The overall challenge faced by the city is to deploy the funding in a sustainable, smart way, that doesn’t age immediately or become an expensive white elephant. Keeping up with the tech industry’s pace is not easy. Using LoRAWAN with MXProtocol, a popular, robust protocol for LPWAN gateways, would be possible and either lower the cost to the city by harvesting MXC (Machine eXchange Coin), or incentivize grassroots participants to add their own gateways or connected devices. Although not a typical application, firmware updates may be sent via LPWAN as well, allow for constant upgrades of security, connectivity, and performance to keep pace with the industry as well.

## Dubai
Dubai’s rise to become a world city and destination in its own right has come through a number of bold initiatives, including of course, the tallest skyscraper in the world, the Burj Khalifa.

Dubai’s ambitions to become the world’s smartest municipality are as high as the 163 floors in Burj Khalifa. The emirate-city aims to improve the happiness of citizens (currently at 90%, with a goal of 95% by 2021) and attract innovation and startups. It is doing so in a number of ways, including rapidly developing machine learning together with IBM to integrate ethical AI into government services and city experiences. It is developing a “UAE Pass”, a digital ID and digital signature to dramatically simplify bureaucracy, all part of an initiative for the Dubai Government to move to paperless governance, with [phase one](https://www.smartdubai.ae/newsroom/news/2019/01/16/dubai-paperless-strategy-completes-phase-one) completed in January 2019. The city is searching to better discover people’s wants and needs, inspire positive change, build awareness and encourage self-reflection.
![Dubai](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/Dubai_ff5bdf5b8b.png)

Dubai is also providing startup support via an [accelerator](https://dtec.ae/dubai-smart-city-accelerator/), providing funding for blockchain initiatives, and the  Dubai Future Accelerators, a program to pair technology companies with government organizations to create new solutions. Another project, [Silicon Park at Dubai Silicon Oasis](https://www.dsoa.ae/en/facilities/silicon-park), is a complete smart environment over 150,000 square metres, combining office space, restaurants, cafes, prayer rooms, a shopping center, parking space for 2500+ cars, with intelligent solutions for lifestyle, sport, mobility, and energy and sustainability.

The significant challenge for Dubai is heavily based on its weather. Providing environmental sustainable air conditioning is somewhat of a tautology while assessing the integrity of buildings during occasional heavy storms are both genuine challenges.

With the help of MXC and a LPWAN rollout, Dubai can lower costs and also be sustainable. Installing sensors and connecting them to LPWAN gateway can give real-time data for better management. The anti-collision feature of MXProtocol supports significantly large operations at scale.

## Pittsburgh
[Pittsburgh’s smart city initiatives](http://smartpittsburgh.org/), working together with USDOT, are significantly focused on improving transportation to improve opportunities for all within Pittsburgh, including disadvantaged and low-income neighborhoods. Better connections serve all citizens to provide access to social and economic hubs, and include elements such as smart, learning traffic lights to solve traffic jams, street lights to monitor traffic and air quality, infrastructure for autonomous and electric vehicles, with a focus on ‘smart spines’, corridors between Pittsburgh’s densest population centers and Downtown and Oakland. A [case study](https://www.rapidflowtech.com/blog/surtrac-deployment-at-urban-grid-networks-in-pittsburgh-neighborhoods) on this system, known as Surtrac, found that it reduced vehicle waiting time at intersections by 40 percent, helping decrease vehicle emissions by 21 percent. 150 more intersections will be upgraded by 2019-20.
![PITTSBURGH](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/PITTSBURGH_2bcb677401.png)

The challenges in continuing to connect Pittsburgh are significant – providing sufficient transportation has economic challenges, and the isolation of low-income neighborhoods is not easily overcome.

MXC in action can provide multiple opportunities for City Hall in PGH. Adding more smart traffic lights to smooth traffic flows and reduce jams is possible using data and sensors.

Harvesting MXC can boost income as well – for example, installing an LPWAN gateway in an area that is isolated can boost the amount of MXC gathered by that gateway, and hence can reach integration of neighborhoods of different income levels.

## San Francisco
While San Francisco is home to some of the world’s most ambitious companies, the city itself is working hard to become a smart city. Hampered by ageing public transport rail infrastructure such as BART and MUNI, which require enormous investment, the city known as SF is exploring transport solutions that include shared and connected electric vehicles. 

In 2017, San Francisco ranked first or second in the International Council on Clean Transportation report for total EV promotion actions, EV uptake, and public and workplace charging infrastructure. 

The city has further implemented legislation, such as the Electric Vehicle Readiness Ordinance, to formalize EV developments. This includes requiring new buildings to install sufficient electrical infrastructure to simultaneously charge (at Level 2 charging) EVs in 20 percent of parking spaces provided. The city is also encouraging private operators by providing [on-street parking spaces](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/drive-park/car-share) for shared vehicles.
![SAN-FRANCISCO](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/SAN-FRANCISCO_b234df75bd.png)

With MXC-led solutions, SF can go further. By providing LPWAN with MXC, vehicles can be connected together with an interchain data market to provide valuable data to vehicle operators and related services.  MXC’s technical anti-collision feature provides sufficiently large scale operations to avoid data collisions.

## Singapore
The city-state of Singapore is a fascinating mix of old colonial and new futuristic, encapsulated by its ever-changing skyline. Given its unique stature, Singapore is aiming to go beyond a smart city to a smart nation, focusing on creating a sustainable, living environment, across many facets. 

Two focuses are transport and health. The city has established a [Smart Elderly Alert System](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/), which via non-intrusive sensors placed in the home, allows the elderly to live independently while providing peace of mind to family members and caregivers. 

Transport is a particularly important issue, with the tiny nation giving up [12% of its land for roads and transport infrastructure](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/#sthash.CuP9GzCA.dpuf). To optimize usage, a multi-faceted approach has been taken, mixing on-demand shuttles, autonomous vehicle infrastructure, contactless fare payments in public transport, and open data to make better decisions. 

An islandwide roll-out of an automated water meter reading system is also underway, to encourage water conservation.
![SINGAPORE (1)](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/SINGAPORE_(1)_d4ce058d33.png)

MXC offers an environmentally friendly, interchain data market, with a built-in anti-collision coordinator. Singapore is a small country, so data-driven decisions are important. MXC enables efficient usage of data to make better decisions.

## The common challenges
These smart cities face many of the same desires and challenges. Data-driven decision making is truly smart decision making. Yet adding and maintaining sensors via a common protocol, along with both storing and making the data publicly available is a problem. 

MXC’s non-profit solution to encourage LPWAN take-up, manage data-collisions, and incentivize grassroots participation, offers significant benefits to these cities, and rapidly urbanizing cities, across the planet.

## Shanghai steps up
One of the first movers is the city of Shanghai in China, which will adopt MXC’s Smart City IoT LPWAN Standard, MXProtocol, announced in early March, following pilots in South Korea and New York City.

“The Shanghai District and MXC are cooperating in the construction of smart cities and the development of the IoT industry,” said Qing Ma, Director of Science and Technology Department of Shanghai Yangpu District. “With this partnership, we expect to increase efficiency and to improve our citizen’s lives.”</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC to present at Berlin Blockchain Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week we released the M2M Payments Mechanism, MXC CEO Sheen Hu will speak at the EIT Annual Conference in Brussels and MXC is about to release something that begins with an “M”.

## *About MXC Foundation*
Before we begin, let’s talk a bit about who we are. MXC Foundation is a Berlin-based, IoT-token that is reshaping the Future of IoT by combining blockchain and LPWAN to improve machine-to-machine communication and data transaction. We strongly believe in the power of data, and everyone’s righteous ownership of their data. This is why we are giving everyone the right to collect, stream, and monetize their data. This is done through a unique combination of hardware and protocol. 

Users can deploy their own LPWAN gateway and/or LPWAN-enabled sensors to collect and stream data. LPWAN gateway owners provide uplink and downlink between the cloud and the sensors, and receive a small amount of MXC as fee. LPWAN-enabled sensor owners can sell their collected data (air quality, soil humidity, noise, etc.) to interested parties for financial compensation in MXC. The amount an LPWAN-enabled sensor pays to the LPWAN gateway is dependent on an automated Smart Machine Bidding (SMB). 

All data transmissions are End-to-End Encrypted, and verified for authenticity. MXC is building world’s largest, and most centralized Data Highway.

Tell us what the code does, and how it benefits future machine-to-machine communication. Make sure to be able to explain your answers!
**Those who provide the correct answer will have a chance at working for MXC Foundation in our Berlin HQ!**

## *How to Apply*

**MXC Foundation releases M2M Payment Mechanism for Machine-to-Machine Payments**

The MXC Foundation, widely known for its integrated Blockchain partnerships with the Chinese government in [Shanghai](https://technode.com/2019/03/11/shanghai-partners-with-mxc-foundation-to-improve-smart-city-technology/) as well as China’s version of Amazon, “[JD.com](https://www.prweb.com/releases/jd_chooses_mxc_to_connect_their_logistics_tracking_with_blockchain/prweb16216844.htm)”, released today the [M2M Payments Mechanism](https://github.com/mxc-foundation), a revolutionary way to automate payments between machines. The M2M Payment Mechanism cleverly enables devices to autonomously process financial transactions within seconds, providing a state-of-the-art device payment mechanism and laying the foundation for automated payments between wireless devices.

“At MXC we’re building a world where literally anyone is able to financially benefit from data, providing Smart City Networks and Device Data connectivity, we’re standing on the verge of the next global data movement,” said Aaron Wagener, co-founder of the MXC Foundation. “This M2M Payment Mechanism is the first step towards building the world’s fastest IoT blockchain machine payment platform.”

The M2M Payments Mechanism allows for rapid transactions between devices. This makes it possible for a wireless sensor to autonomously pay for network access without requiring oversight or authorization from the company owning it. If it has data to send, it will pay for the access needed to send this data. 

As part of the mechanism, device owners will have the option to subscribe various LPWAN sensors to third-party LPWAN Gateways. This creates a whole new level of mobility among LoRaWAN sensors while providing multiple failover options to ensure the steady and reliable transmission of the collected data.

Corporate partners also benefit from the MXC M2M Payments Mechanism. Part of this software release adds the tools needed for corporate adoption of the [MXProtocol](https://blog.mxc.org/mxprotocol-explained-mxc/); including transaction history, low balance warnings, device subscription management and the ability to generate invoices.
MXC’s M2M Payments Mechanism integrates flawlessly with the AXS Wallet, providing a single dashboard from which to manage both MXC and MXC earnings from MXProtocol enabled LPWAN devices, providing a mechanism to profit from the devices of this world. Anyone wishing to contribute to, or view the code behind MXC M2M Payments Mechanism can find it in the open-source [MXC Foundation GitHub repository](https://github.com/mxc-foundation).</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC to Donate €200,000 to Berlin Vietnamese Market]]></title><description><![CDATA[Following a recent firey disaster at Dong Xuan Center in Berlin, MXC and MatchX are donating €200,000 worth of fire prevention equipment.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-to-donate-e200000-to-berlin-vietnamese-market</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-to-donate-e200000-to-berlin-vietnamese-market</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC to Donate €200,000 to Berlin Vietnamese Market
MXC working to add early fire detection systems in Berlin, Jeff is back from China and we are releasing the largest news in MXC history, later this week. Welcome to this week’s news update.

MXC is working with hardware partner MatchX to donate 200.000 Euros worth of fire detection systems to the Dong Xi’an center in Berlin. This past week the Vietnamese market experienced a tragic fire that early detection could have reduced. To this end, we will supply the center with fire detection sensors, an AI-enabled LPWAN camera, and an LPWAN gateway.

Jeff is back from his trip to China and his epic move across Berlin. While in China he met with the Shanghai Yangpu District Government to check on the progress of the Shanghai project. He also met with MXC supporter Fenbushi, as well as a number of interested companies on the Nanjing Tech Week Exhibit floor.

Keep your eyes on MXC this week as some epic news is about to be released. Can’t say more in this now, but be sure to follow all of the MXC channels to keep up-to-date on the latest news.

This has been this week’s news update. I look forward to speaking with all of you again next week. Until then, get active, get in the community, as us questions — because it’s only together that we can build the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Token Release Program]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC has chosen to take an unprecedented move towards investor token holdings, giving investors the chance to opt for early release of their token lock.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-token-release-program</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-token-release-program</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Token Release Program
**MXC has chosen to take an unprecedented move towards investor token holdings, we believe that this move is both confident but calculated, bold but necessary, and it’s something which will see token decentralisation pushed to the forefront of MXC. This move, we believe, is one that will secure MXC and investors for the long term.**
![MXC-token-release-program-1-1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-token-release-program-1-1_60b2d65461.png)

The Crypto world has experienced some tumultuous times, none more than in the last 12 months. At MXC we’ve been witness to a lot of these market changes in a time where “tokens” as a whole are jockeying for both relevance and implementation in an ever-changing world.

MXC has, with a large sense of deliberateness, we’ve chosen to take the alternative approach to the standard Crypto market. We choose to take the road less travelled, always insisting on offering clear, transparent and understandable use cases and a real purpose for the MXC token.

A little over 6 months ago MXC launched on Huobi, MXC’s first Token Exchange, since then we’ve made some sensational ground-breaking deals with the Shanghai Government, we’ve experienced incredible growth, created a high level of understanding with our core MXC supporters and signed with 3 Top 10 Crypto exchanges, free of charge.
![MXC-token-release-program-2-1-opt1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/MXC-token-release-program-2-1-opt1_7de1d675ab.png)

As part of our continued commitment to our supporters, MXC is looking now to continue our unconventional course, changing the perception of tokenisation and MXC as a whole. As a result, we’re introducing a revolutionary measure, the **MXC TOKEN RELEASE PROGRAM**. By implementing this program, we firmly believe that MXC increases liquidity, market focus and overall decentralisation of the MXC token.

MXC is preparing to release investor locks to both Early and Pre-Sale investors. The entire MXC team believes so strongly in our movement that we’re handing the power back to the investors, for them to individually decide what they choose to do with their investment. Now, as Peter Parker will remind us, with great power comes great responsibility, this is why MXC has implemented an additional reward / sacrifice model as part and parcel of the **MXC TOKEN RELEASE PROGRAM**.

MXC is offering an immediate release of all Early Investor and Pre-Sale Token locks on the 1st of July, 2019. However, for all investors who choose to engage in the Token Release Option a total of 20% of the investors complete invested MXC portfolio tokens will be sacrificed and burnt as a result of the lock release. Using this method, we believe we have reached a fair balance in regards to a reward and sacrifice model.

**AI &amp; Big Data Expo [Europe 2019]**
Wednesday, July 19 at 12:40pm

*Location: RAI Amsterdam, Europaplein 2-22, 1078 GZ*

LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) technology can be used together with blockchains as an infrastructure for IoT. This combination automates machine to machine transactions and provides a device data economy (e.g. in MXProtocol). Smart Machine Bidding (SMB), provides an incentive solution to automate the payments related to the flow of IoT devices data.

By SMB, each gateway can offer different bids on its data transmission cost. The LPWAN devices can smartly choose a gateway to transmit their data with. Data-driven algorithms are also used in the SMB to automate and optimize the procedure.

In general, the SMB helps to provide a cost-effective shared LPWAN which both gateway owners and device owners can profit from. In this talk, SMB procedure, its applications, and corresponding data-driven algorithms will be discussed.

*Original script in English*
Last week was busy! We are working with ASE to build a AI enhanced LoRa System-in-Package, our website received an overhaul, you can now redeem your MXC Metal Coin for MXC and we have some exciting events heading your way. Welcome to the MXC News Update!

## Building an AI-Enhanced LoRa SiP with ASE Group
We are working with ASE Group, the micro-chip manufacturer that supplies chips for Apple mobile devices, to build an AI enhanced LoRa system-in-package. This is big folks!

What is a system in package? It’s a type of chip commonly used as the brains in tech including mobile phones and smart watches.

Our chip will have an embedded AI, making it possible for an LPWAN sensor to analyse data directly on the sensor, instead of sending it a cloud service for analysis. What does this mean for the market?

First, the only chip currently available for LoRa tech is provided by a single manufacturer. Our chip will not only provide another option, it’s open source technology, meaning anyone can take the schematics and develop their own technology with it. Breaking open the LPWAN market for new innovation.

Second, we’re opening LPWAN to be used for data types that traditionally took too much bandwidth to transmit. With the MXC Chip sensors working with video or audio data can now analyse the data and send the results via LPWAN. Any data type that was too big to be transmitted over LPWAN networks now has a chance!

## New Website Now Live
Our marketing team has launched the newest version of the MXC Website. Focused heavily on the potential use cases for MXC, either for cities, companies, and for our community members. Be sure to check it out and give us your feedback directly in our Telegram group. If you don’t understand something, or believe it can be better presented, we want to hear your ideas!

## What is the Reputation System?
The Reputation System is an internally-built mechanism inside the MXC Foundation Telegram Community. It allows users to upvote helpful comments, contributing to a positive reputation building for those who contribute to the community. There are different levels of reputation and users can climb the level structure to the very top. The reputation levels will help high-contributing supporters to be easily recognizable, ensuring that their knowledgeable inputs are valued. Those with a high level of reputation may enjoy increased benefits, such as bonus multiplier on all airdrops, free MXC merchandises, and receiving invitations to MeetUps, events, and exclusive parties.
Users can upvote with **/rep** command. Reputation Level can be checked with **/myrep**. If you would like to see the top leaderboard, use **/toprep [limit]**. For example, if you’d like to see the top 30, type **/toprep 30**. If you wish to give more than 1 upvote, use **/rep [number]** to give that amount of upvote. For example, **/rep 5** would give 5 upvotes.

## How can I earn Reputation Points?
All users can upvote any messages they deem to be helpful. To prevent malicious usage of the privilege, a user can give a maximum of 10 upvotes per 24 hour period. After 24 hours, the upvote count will be refreshed.
Supporters can also earn Reputation Points by contributing to the community. This includes writing contents, sharing MXC news on social media, and other means of increasing the public’s awareness of MXC and our mission. These high levels of contributions will not only encourage other users to upvote but also will result in Reputation Point grants from the admins. The Reputation Point grants can range from a minimum of 10 upvotes to a maximum of 150 upvotes for messages on Telegram.
If you choose to write an **article** about MXC, each article may receive up to **1500 Reputation Points**.
If you choose to make a **video** about MXC, each video may receive up to **2000 Reputation Points**.
You may also get up to **20 Reputation Points** for sharing the MXC News Update and other social media updates on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
Every Tuesday, there will also be an **MXC Quiz** on Telegram. Quiz participants can get up to **50 Reputation Points**.

Please note that the reputation points reward cannot coincide with other MXC promotions (e.g. #MXCGiveaway).

## Can I downvote a message?
The need for a community-ran reporting system has been recognized since long ago. However, a downvote system could result in unpredictable scenarios when misused. Hence, downvoting a message is not possible. If a user would like to report a message, s/he can simply respond to the message with **/report** to report the message. Once reported, the admins will take appropriate actions.

## What levels are there, and what are the advantages?

MXC reducing [electricity consumption in South Korea](https://www.mxc.org/blog/korean-national-electricity-grid-withsystem), hosting parties and participating in [Longhash Cryptocon Vo.2](https://hack.longhash.com/#/). You won’t believe what we have for you this week.

Electricity consumption in South Korea is becoming a problem, having risen over 550 percent during the past three decades. Overstressed power-plants are struggling to keep up, causing occasional blackouts and other issues in the national grid.

We’re working closely with Korean company WithSystem to provide a consumer alert system, letting people know when the grid is struggling so they can turn off an extra appliance or two to avoid that blackout. Construction on the consumer alert system is planned to begin late 2019.

As our new office takes shape, we decided to host a party for some of the kings in Crypto. This week we’ll host VeChain, Gate.io, Fenbushi and Longhash for a small mixer, for them to get a close look at our new office, get to know our team, and hear more about how MXC is changing the world, one partnership at a time.

Co-Founder Aaron Wagener will join a panel discussing blockchain adoption Friday May 17 at the LongHash Cryptocon Vo.2. If you’re in Berlin, this is an event you don’t want to miss! Last time Aaron was on a panel, he promptly told the other panelists they were wrong, and explained in depth the logic behind it. How will he mix it up this week? You need to be there to find out! Or watch next week’s news update.

After the panel we are sponsoring a Hackathon Challenge on [LPWAN and smart bidding](https://dataconomy.com/2019/05/lpwan-can-provide-a-cost-effective%E2%80%8B-network-for-iot/). Take a look at the link in the description below to participate and gain a chance to win a sizeable prize in MXC. Honestly, when I saw this, I thought about becoming a developer.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Token Accesses Korean National Electricity Grid]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC Foundation partnered with WithSystemto reduce electricity consumption throughout South Korea by building an electricity monitoring and alert platform.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/korean-national-electricity-grid-withsystem</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/korean-national-electricity-grid-withsystem</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Token Accesses Korean National Electricity Grid
In an effort to significantly reduce energy consumption throughout South Korea, the Berlin-based non-profit and global IoT token, MXC Foundation partnered with [WithSystem](https://withsystem.co.kr/), one of South Korea’s most respected energy facilitators, to reduce electricity consumption throughout South Korea by building a first-time electricity monitoring and consumer alert platform incorporating LPWAN, the Machine Xchange Coin (MXC) and the MXProtocol.

Electricity consumption in South Korea increased by 550 percent over the past 3 decades, causing a massive strain on the national grid. A number of reasons have been given for this significant spike, namely the technological revolution that has engrossed much of the Korean nation. To combat this, WithSystem is introducing a one-of-a-kind monitoring system which alerts users of peak usage times and excessive household usage, working together with the MXC Foundation, Korean citizens will receive notifications of electricity usage and suggestions of how they can reduce their daily consumption.

“Many issues facing governments and electricity companies come from the excess consumption of energy,” said ChangHwan Cho, CEO at WithSystem. “The key factor as to why this excessive usage occurs is the fact that many are unaware or unable to control their general electricity consumption. By demonstrating such wastage, we aim to inspire people to turn off appliances and choose more environmentally power-friendly devices.”

Sensors measuring electricity consumption will use the Machine Xchange Coin and their MXProtocol to validate the source of the collected data, adding a layer of trust and accountability to the energy consumption alerts. The data will then be added to the MXC Data Market, ensuring complete compatibility with any third party integrations.

“MXC is working to improve how individuals collect and manage data on a global scale,” said Aaron Wagener, Co-Founder at the MXC Foundation. “Our partnership with WithSystem is another example of the versatility of the Machine Xchange Coin and our global MXC IoT solution.”

The initial construction and rollout is planned to begin late 2019.

The MXC Foundation is a purpose-built Blockchain Foundation, based in Berlin. Its mission is to inspire fast, efficient, decentralized data exchanges using LPWAN and Blockchain technology. MXC is currently working on projects in New York City, South Korea, and Shanghai.

WithSystem is one of Korea’s most respected energy facilitators, working directly with the Korean government. WithSystem operates and facilitiates the national electricity grid throughout South-Korea and as part of their national roll-out, WithSystem is looking to inform and reduce citizens energy usage via a number of electricity monitor alerts.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[All You Need to Know about MXC - ASE Partnership]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC will work closely with ASE to improve AI in LoRaWAN sensors and blockchain technologies.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-ase-partnership</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-ase-partnership</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## All You Need to Know about MXC – ASE Partnership
## ASE – MXC Partnership: What’s the Significance?
On May 2nd, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and MXC Foundation announced a new partnership to bring an AI Blockchain-enabled microchip to the global market. What does the newly announced partnership between MXC and ASE signify?

## Breaking into the long-held monopoly
The open-source LPWAN System-in-Package (SiP) will decentralize the global LPWAN sector.
For years, LPWAN-chip industry was dictated by [one company with complete monopolistic control of the market](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/iot/drawing-a-line-in-the-bands). This resulted in the creation of a single point of failure that kept many potential projects from using LPWAN. With the new partnership between MXC Foundation and ASE Corporation, the entire LPWAN industry can benefit from lower prices and increased technological advancement.

## MXProtocol in Mobile Phones and Laptops
Traditionally, LPWAN sensors were not an option to collect heavy data packets such as audio and visuals, requiring video and audio sensors to use WiFi or LTE networks. This resulted in increased cost due to either the usage of more power-hungry networks or the requirement of a monthly fee. With the partnership between MXC and ASE, the microchip with an embedded Artificial Intelligence (AI) will allow devices to locally analyze audio-visual data and utilize LoRaWAN with the MXProtocol to send the relevant data in a fast and efficient manner within a massive range of 40km.

ASE is a primary chip supplier to Apple and other major companies, opening an entirely new avenue for the much-beloved consumer devices (such as iPhones and MacBooks) to leverage LPWAN connectivity. This makes it possible for consumer electronics to benefit from LPWAN-based MXProtocol, allowing consumers to easily collect data from their everyday surroundings, providing them the option to monetize this data using the MXC Data Market. This outcome would allow further development from both the LPWAN sector and consumer electronics sector.

## Potential for an Entirely New Generation of Smart Devices
This expansion of LPWAN chips to process audio and visual data builds the potential for an entirely new generation of smart devices. In the current data-heavy world, smart devices that travel with us on a daily basis are exposed to hundreds of packages of data. The tri-factor combination of audio-visual data, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain-enabled LPWAN allow the general public to partake in data collection in a confidently accurate, large-scale manner. For example, a smart device that measures the noise level around the user can analyze the data using Artificial Intelligence, pair the collected data to the area, and send the analysis in real-time through the MXProtocol. Consequently, this would allow users to single-handedly map out areas with lots of noise pollution to help city planners or choose to sell the data their devices collect.

## So What’s Next?
MXC will work closely with ASE to roll out the revolutionary technology, improving AI in blockchain to automatically analyze audio-visual data and further developing the ultra-efficient channel data to be sent to the cloud. MXC and ASE will also introduce the MXProtocol-embedded, Blockchain-enabled AI microchip to smart devices around the world. The first pilot chips will be released in 2019 and be deployed to the on-going implementation of the MXProtocol in Shanghai. The market entrance of the new microchip is expected to be early 2020.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC in Portugal, and Growing Team]]></title><description><![CDATA[On May 2, MXC CEO Xin Hu will be traveling to Portugal for EIT Digital Conference.

## Trade MXC directly with FIAT on ChainX
For the first time since the MXC token was released, MXC will be traded directly with fiat currency. ChainX, one of the most connected cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, will add the MXC token to their exchange and pair MXC with the South Korean Won. By allowing customers to trade fiat currency with MXC, ChainX simplifies the adoption of the MXC Smart City Standard in South Korea.

“By pairing MXC directly with a fiat currency, we are making ChainX the exchange of choice for MXC in South Korea,” said Jackson Koo, Managing Director at ChainX. “It is much easier for the governments and companies adopting the MXC Smart City Standard to track expenses when trading fiat directly for MXC.”

ChainX was created “bottom-up” by a group of blockchain influencers, interested in building a decentralized exchange starting with decentralized management. This makes it a unique exchange, as the exchange is built based on the public feedback these influencers receive. Therefore, As part of the listing strategy, ChainX will be running a massive marketing campaign throughout the following weeks, making MXC the most prominent IoT token available on the ChainX cryptocurrency exchange. Among the promotions are token airdrops, a discounted trading fee, and exclusive ChainX exchange benefits to MXC traders when the trading volume exceeds 8.7 million USD. Announcements regarding ChainX promotions for MXC will be available on the ChainX website or through the ChainX announcement channel.

“Listing on ChainX is part of our strategy to ensure that MXC is easily available to anyone around the globe,” said Aaron Wagener, Co-Founder at the MXC Foundation. “By ensuring easy access to the MXC token, we reduce any potential barriers to the adoption of the MXC Smart City Standard.”

ChainX will list a South Korean Won to MXC pair on Tuesday, April 16, at 12:00 (noon) CET.

This is the first stop on the MXC Data Highway.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-government-deal-shanghai</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-government-deal-shanghai</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Reaches Government Deal in Shanghai
## Smarter Governance in Connected Shanghai
## 26 million populous, infinitely popular
Shanghai is the world’s most populous city, with a population of just over 26 million. At such height of population, the importance of data becomes ever so stark. However, each mission of collecting the right set of data involves a large scale effort and a large enough infrastructure to support it. Especially with connected devices reaching a higher number than 26 million, a new, sustainable data highway must be built.
Shanghai also happens to be a popular place for many headquarters that hails from all over the world. With favorable market conditions and highly engaged customer base, hundreds of companies establish themselves in the city to bring the next innovation. Even though each organization is an excellent innovator in its own rights, the inventions tend to be fragmented from one other and fails to communicate with other projects.

## Building a sustainable new Data Highway
MXC is providing an innovative solution to the government of Shanghai Yangpu District. As the government installs sensors to measure different aspects of the living, breathing city, the demand for new infrastructure that can support such a massive amount of data traffic becomes an utmost necessity. Along with the rise of IoT devices – such as smart streetlights, connected home furniture, and even smart parking spaces – the requirement is a sustainable, new Data Highway.
MXC is bringing decentralized LPWAN (Low Power, Wide Area Network) to Shanghai. The decentralization aspect empowers all residents of the city to participate by installing their own LPWAN gateways, registered with the MXProtocol. To ensure that the entire urban area is covered, MXC has already begun a series of hardware rollouts. Utilizing LPWAN instead of much-discussed 4G and 5G brings multiple benefits. LPWAN uses fewer resources, thus becoming both economically and environmentally sustainable. It invites residents to take part, unlike heavily centralized 4G and 5G. With LPWAN-based MXProtocol, millions of data transmission can occur collision-free. Built-in Smart Machine Bidding (SMB) also gives way for time-sensitive data to travel faster.
All data transmissions in MXProtocol are End-to-End encrypted, tamper-proofing data each data transmission with titanium security. This allows for more accountable and trustworthy data for the government and other organizations involved, resulting in smarter governance. The entire MXProtocol is powered by the MXC token.

## Connecting Projects, Connecting People
As mentioned, Shanghai is the home to hundreds of companies that are bringing the next wave of innovation. However, the counts of a dozen “smart” projects lack inter-connectivity. Each smart project may be groundbreaking, yet fails to achieve any synergizing effect as these projects do not communicate with each other. The exclusivity of each project’s platform can be inconvenient to the residents of Shanghai. Hence, MXC is bringing *Smart City IoT Standard* to Shanghai.
Using the open-source MXProtocol as the foundation, smart projects can effectively solve long-dreaded issues such as scalability and data transmission efficacy. Without intensive technological changes, projects that are built on MXProtocol can be better connected to other smart projects, and monetize the data they collect on the interchain data market. The MXProtocol allows for smart projects to build together, share data, monetize collected data, and be rested in security while doing so. It also allows the government of Shanghai to enjoy heightened benefits, thanks to the collaborative series of innovations.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC in Shanghai, Microsoft, and Hannover]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC is responsible for deploying LPWAN hardware in the Yangpu district of Shanghai.

Regardless of what forms it may take during gestation, this book describes what the Real Internet of Things will inevitably become.

- [**Inventing Future Cities by Michael Batty**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KYBMT8D/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1). In this book, Michael Batty explores what we need to understand about cities in order to invent their future. Batty discusses the approaching great transition from a world with few cities to a world of all cities and argues that future cities will be defined as clusters in a hierarchy. He describes the future “high-frequency”, real-time streaming city, considers urban sprawl and urban renewal, and maps the waves of technological change, which grow ever more intense and can lead to continuous innovation — an unending process of creative destruction out of which future cities will emerge.

- [**The Smart City Transformations: The Revolution of The 21st Century by Amitabh Satyam and Igor Calzada**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742CW1D8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1). Smart city concepts address the dual objectives of sustainability and improvement in the quality of life. Developing smart cities is a stated objective of many governments and corporations worldwide, and as the global population increases, the world must move towards a smarter use of available resources. Smart concepts integrate a diverse set of assets, expertise and capabilities, and invoke the knowledge areas of business management, behavioural science, political science, electronics, computing, mathematics, economics, city administration, and project management. No area of knowledge is untouched. Smart transformation is the revolution of the twenty-first century.

- [**Sharing Cities: A Case for Truly Smart and Sustainable Cities by Duncan McLaren and Julian Agyeman**](https://www.amazon.com/Sharing-Cities-Sustainable-Industrial-Environments/dp/0262029723). The future of humanity is urban, and the nature of urban space enables, and necessitates, sharing — of resources, goods and services, experiences. Yet traditional forms of sharing have been undermined in modern cities by social fragmentation and commercialization of the public realm. In Sharing Cities, Duncan McLaren and Julian Agyeman argue that the intersection of cities’ highly networked physical space with new digital technologies and new mediated forms of sharing offers cities the opportunity to connect smart technology to justice, solidarity, and sustainability. The authors explore the opportunities and risks for sustainability, solidarity, and justice in the changing nature of sharing.

The Inversion Factor explains why the companies of today and tomorrow will have to abandon the product-first orientation. They chart the evolution of three IoTs―the Internet of Things (devices connected to the Internet), the Intelligence of Things (devices that host software applications), and the Innovation of Things (devices that become experiences). Finally, they offer a blueprint for businesses making the transition to inversion and interviews with leaders of major companies and game-changing startups.

- [**Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia by Anthony M. Townsend**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CF2M9AA/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stppvp_1?pf_rd_p=d45777d6-4c64-4117-8332-1659db52e64f&amp;pd_rd_wg=E4bOV&amp;pf_rd_r=20GEQ2M3W0H6Q35T6G3Z&amp;pd_rd_i=B00CF2M9AA&amp;pd_rd_w=LddGa&amp;pd_rd_r=45968822-5331-4227-b37e-8bd1ccef86fa&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547377933&amp;sr=1). From Beijing to Boston, cities are deploying smart technology—sensors embedded in streets and subways, Wi-Fi broadcast airports and green spaces—to address the basic challenges faced by massive, interconnected metropolitan centers. In Smart Cities, Anthony M. Townsend documents this emerging futuristic landscape while considering the motivations, aspirations, and shortcomings of the key actors—entrepreneurs, mayors, philanthropists, and software developers—at work in shaping the new urban frontier.

In the current times, it is trendy to stay #woke and #cultured. We couldn’t think of a better time to promote this additional knowledge with our community than the widely celebrated Lunar New Year. So, let’s take a little pause and go #moon on the Lunar calendar.

## Why is the Year Named After an Animal?
You probably have already heard of “the year of (insert an animal here)”. The animal isn’t randomly decided. There are 12 animals that come from Asian folklore that tell the story of 12 animals participating in a race (unfortunately, this was before the ages of live broadcast). Each of the 12 lunar new years is named after each animal, coming from the 1st animal to finish the race, to the last. The pig came last, so this year marks a complete cycle of 12 lunar new years.

## What is Lunar New Year?
Lunar New Year, often called Chinese New Year, is marked as the first of January according to the moon-based Lunar calendar. Contrary to the popular belief, traditional Lunar calendar is lunisolar – meaning it’s based on both the phase of the moon and Earth’s rotation around the sun. This additional factor allows the calendar to have around 354 days instead of the 365 days as the Gregorian calendar. The different number of days in a year makes the Lunar New Year happen on the different Gregorian day every year. Hence, many residents of Asian countries flip through the calendar every year to check the day and better plan vacations. So, how do these countries celebrate Lunar New Year?

## Lunar New Year in China
China: Chinese New Year, often celebrated as Spring Festival, is one of the largest festivals to happen around the world. People celebrate everything spring represents – a fresh start, planting new harvests, and perhaps the end of grueling cold months. Traditionally, Chinese New Year was a day to pray to the ancestors, who were often thought to have godly powers to watch over the household. This tradition becomes much more interesting with the myth of a brave boy who fought a monster. Years before, Chinese New Year Eve was plagued by a monster that instilled fear in people’s hearts. Many people hid in their homes until one brave boy fought off the monster using firecrackers. To celebrate this, the Chinese set off many firecrackers at midnight to chase away bad luck. Many often burn fake money to honour their ancestors. The festival that lasts 16 days also encourage families to spend their time together. At the time, the world witnesses the largest human migration of the year. Many travels to their family homes for Chinese New Year Eve to attend a family dinner that often sees fish and dumplings as some of the dishes, that represents wealth and good luck. The meal is followed by desserts that are associated with wealth and good luck, often by wordplay in their names or their shapes. During this time, certain activities are considered taboo. Getting haircuts or using sharp objects, swearing and using unlucky words, along with breaking objects are discouraged. However, children enjoy more benefits as they receive pretty much the biggest airdrop ever – lucky money in red envelopes.

## Lunar New Year in Korea
Korea: Known as “Suhlnal”, Lunar New Year celebration in Korea is short compared to China. It is celebrated for 3 days, as many also travel to the countryside to visit family members. During this time, the capital Seoul often feels empty while the roads down south become packed with traffic. On New Year, Koreans start the morning with fresh showers and dressing in new clothes. This symbolizes washing away bad luck and starting fresh. Use of firecrackers are not very common, as Koreans prefer to start the New Year on a calm note. This perhaps goes along with the country being referred to as “the Land of the Morning Calm”. Koreans eat rice cake soup for breakfast, as the chewy texture of the rice cake is believed to help good luck stick. The common belief says each bowl of rice cake soup (Ddeukgook) represents getting 1 year older. Hence, the hungry ones often hear the joke “you are now 2 years older”. Then, Koreans dress in their best attire and give new year blessing to their elders in a special form of bowing (juhl). The bowing sees a person’s knees and elbows on the ground, and the forehead also touching the ground. This symbolizes ultimate respect. The elders would give blessings, and the youngers return the blessing. Children also often receive lucky money in white envelopes. The white envelops do not symbolize much, yet it is the most common as they are readily available.

## Lunar New Year in Vietnam
Vietnam: Called “Tet”, Vietnamese Lunar New Year is one of the biggest holidays in the country and the most popular. “Tet” is a shortened word that means “First Morning of the First Day” in Sino-Vietnamese. Like in other countries, Vietnamese also travel to see their families. However, there are strict guidelines for entering someone else’s house. Vietnamese strongly believe that the first guest to enter the house on Tet determines the luck for the family of the year. Hence, it is strongly advised to not enter someone’s house without an invitation. According to Vietnamese beliefs, the luck on Tet determines the luck for the rest of the year. Therefore, everything during Tet must be carefully coordinated. After exchanging special Tet greetings, children receive money in red envelopes. The homes are decorated with different flowers to symbolize blossoms of good luck. Then, families travel to the burial sites of ancestors to clean the grave as a sign of respect. The streets are filled with loud noises from firecrackers, drums, and gongs, as people try to make as much noise as possible to ward off evil spirits. Vietnamese would often see large bamboo poles on the street, with decorations on top. The celebrations are paired with traditional foods such as sticky rice wrapped in Dong leaves or banana leaves, roasted watermelon seeds, pickled onions and cabbages, coconut candy, peanut brittle, and red sticky rice. All these dishes symbolize breaking of bad luck, and attraction of good luck throughout the year.

## And Many More…
Of course, there are many other countries that celebrate the Lunar New Year such as Singapore and Malaysia. This article would be a very long read, as each country has its own traditions. However, the unifying theme is clear: family, unity, and new beginnings. As we celebrate Lunar New Year with our Asian communities, we wish everyone a happy Lunar New Year and only the best for the rest of the year. MXC will continue to deliver exciting and great results throughout the year, as we refresh our mind today to focus on leading the Future of IoT. Happy Lunar New Year!</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Improves Public Health in South Korea]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-public-health-south-korea</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-public-health-south-korea</guid><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Improves Public Health in South Korea
## Greener and Safer Outdoor Space, Powered by MXC
MXC, EnLink, and MatchX are building smart city solutions to improve the quality of life in South Korea. Combined, these solutions assure Koreans that:

- the air they breathe is safe
- their favorite outdoor location isn’t plagued by mosquitoes
- every possible step is being taken to evaluate the risk of impending earthquakes

This is blockchain at work, with full integration, and implementation.

## No Mosquitoes? Bingo!
![insect-catcher-02](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/insect-catcher-02_5e3d6ee395.png)
South Korean summers are full of sun, outdoor activities and picnics. Unfortunately, they are also full of mosquitos. EnLink’s IZAP Pro is an LPWAN enabled insect trap that collects valuable data about insects, and the surrounding environment. With sensors installed in over 13,000 parks, the collected data has the potential to provide unique insights about park pests in South Korea. MXProtocol enables these devices to list the data on the MXC Cortex (inter-chain data market). Data listed in the market can be used by developers wishing to give potential picnickers insight into mosquito levels in local parks.

## Busting the Yellow Dust
Air quality in South Korea is a real danger to public health. Yellow dust from China’s Gobi Desert invades Korea, carrying with it, variety of pollutants including heavy metals, bacteria, and viruses. EnLink manufactures an LPWAN enabled fine dust sensor and alarm system that provides real-time air quality warnings. By connecting air quality sensors to the MXC Cortex, developers can easily integrate live, localized data into apps designed to tell people when it’s better to stay inside.
![air-quality-02](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/air-quality-02_ab9e5f1dcf.png)

## Ground-splitting earthquakes require groundbreaking solutions
Though Korea is relatively protected from earthquakes, it is not immune. Earthquakes in 2016 and 2017 demonstrated that new technology is required to assess risk and warn people when the probability of an earthquake is high. EnLink manufactures an LED light with a built-in earthquake sensor, making it possible for people to crowdsource the data needed to build an earthquake detection system. Integration with the MXC Cortex lists all of the data from each individual sensor on one platform for simplified data analysis and integration.

The MXC team believes that MXC paired with LPWAN is the next step in the fourth industrial revolution, creating a Smart City Standard for the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Did your Smart City choose the right network?]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/did-your-smart-city-choose-the-right-network</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/did-your-smart-city-choose-the-right-network</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Did your Smart City choose the right network?
**The importance of wireless in smart cities, and why LPWAN is the clear and obvious solution.**

For those of you who aren’t familiar, smart cities are the intended end project of all of the ‘smart’ projects being floated all around the world, either on [small scales](https://ethereumworldnews.com/mxc-smart-city-integration-launches-in-nyc/) or in a few really large scale integrated projects like in Dubai and Singapore. Smart cities aim to [automate large parts of everyday life](https://e27.co/iot-ai-and-data-contribute-to-smart-city-initiatives-and-here-are-practical-things-we-can-expect-from-major-cities-20181219/), and to make extensive use of the ‘internet of things (IoT) to help those automated systems actually understand what is going on in the physical world – the realm of full trash bins, crowded sidewalks and refrigerators distressingly empty of whatever it was we want for breakfast.

If you’d like to know more, I just happen to have written a [larger piece about exactly that](https://e27.co/iot-ai-and-data-contribute-to-smart-city-initiatives-and-here-are-practical-things-we-can-expect-from-major-cities-20181219/). Go on, read it. I’ll wait.

## Why Wireless?
wire-spaghettiSimply put, no one wants to live in the tangled mess (or the infinitely cable-tied techno-utopia) that lurks behind your company’s server racks. If you didn’t get that reference, you need to educate yourself. Go to your nearest IT person and ask to see ‘the blue spaghetti behind the servers’. They’ll take you on an amazing journey.

But really, there is just no physical way to connect the soon-to-be millions of IoT enabled devices in even a small sized smart city with wires. Every street light, every pressure plate on the paths, and every other sensor or state tracker would need a wire.

Worse, the most useful IoT devices need to be attached to things that move! Smart Cities need to track individual dumpsters and wheelie bins, individual pallets, and cargo containers, perhaps even individual containers of fruit juice in your fridge.

Can you imagine all of that as part of a wired network? I don’t think the Earth produces that much copper in 100 years, just for a start.

## But surely it can’t be that easy. Just throwing the word ‘wireless’ at the problem won’t fix it.
That’s true. There are several good reasons why standard wireless networks and protocols just won’t work either.

First, standard wireless has a cripplingly short range. In the best of conditions, a Wi-Fi transmitter has to be within a hundred feet of the receiver. 4G works out to around 16 miles, again under nearly ideal conditions. The thing is, a modern city is about as far from ‘ideal conditions’ for wireless networks as you can get. Unless every house, every small business and every floor of every large building is to be equipped with a ‘civic infrastructure router’, it could never work. For that matter, the added networks would drastically increase a problem called [data collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-KBfXx15GE)!

Second, standard wireless solutions simply consume too much power. IoT devices for a smart city need to be small, they need to be maintenance free, and they need to ‘just work’ for months at a minimum between charges. Ideally, they’ll work for a year or so, then be recycled or replaced. Imagine the power your phone would use connecting to Wi-Fi or 4G for a year between charges! That’s not what Tesla is building those 300-pound batteries for.

Third, standard Wi-Fi networks just aren’t configured to handle thousands of different devices at once (or 4G to handle 100s of thousands), and that’s what each node would have to handle, even if the networks were limited to current sizes. Most IoT devices aren’t ‘smart’ enough to check that their data packets went through, either, so every time there was a ‘[data collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-KBfXx15GE)’ or device 22394 wasn’t actually connected because it was 3rd in the queue for resources, the data would just be lost.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-KBfXx15GE

## So, does that mean wireless isn’t the answer? No.
Not at all. Wireless is the only practical way to approach the issue, and it is the solution actual smart cities are using. They just aren’t using 4G or even 5G or Wi-Fi. They are using [Low-Power wide Area Networks (LPWANs)](https://medium.com/mxc/benefits-and-limitations-of-lpwan-71d725510950) to connect entire towns and whole sections of major cities into IoT-specific wireless networks. Amazingly, they are doing it in a practical, low maintenance and commercially viable manner, too!

## LPWANs connect tomorrow’s smart cities.
How do we know? Because they are doing the job today. Cities looking to deploy massive LPWAN solutions face the problem of [data collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-KBfXx15GE). MXC solves this by incorporating blockchain into LoRAWAN solutions, so I’ll be using that as the primary example.

## OK, break that down for me – ‘practical’?
Practicality can be broken down into smaller parts. First is the necessity for truly large IoT networks. LPWAN networks have been proven to connect IoT devices reliably over networks covering tens of square miles, and the potential size is increasing steadily as the technology matures.

Next is the issue of data collisions. The LoRAWAN / MXProtocol combo easily fixes this. It incorporates cutting edge [data collision protection](https://www.mxc.org/hubfs/WP/MXC_technical_whitepaper.pdf?t=1528200030825) from the beginning, governing the priority of different IoT traffic in a complex and balanced way, delaying some signals rather than losing them. As to how it chooses which signals to delay, I address that below under ‘commercial viability’ – essentially, it monetizes network resources, allowing the users to set their own data priorities.

After that comes security. This is one of the ways the blockchain aspect of the technology becomes important by providing a complete ledger of M2M communication passing between LPWAN enabled devices owned by different people. Of course – under most of the systems being developed, all of the data on the network is also encrypted.

Even more importantly, some of these developing solutions support 2-way connections with IoT devices. A system like that could track lost packets and send a ‘resend’ command. It could also reschedule individual devices’ transmission schedules to smooth demand peaks on the network over the long term. Note, the systems themselves do this, not an army of human operators.

## And how is this technology ‘low maintenance’?
That largely comes down to power requirements. All LPWAN solutions are substantially lower power than Wi-Fi or 4G solutions. They were designed with the IoT in mind, and support networks of thousands or millions of discrete devices which run on stored power for up to ten years at a time. Even if the networks themselves don’t become more effective, every generation of IoT devices becomes a little more power efficient and holds a larger charge. As a result, this is a rare example of a solution which gets better as it ages!

In a few of these next-generation systems, the network infrastructure is handled commercially by 3rd parties. These operators keep the networks up and running in order to keep their income stream (and typically to run their own IoT devices) functioning. Again, more on that below.

## And now the hard part – ‘commercially viable’?
OK, so here is the really impressive bit. A few of these next-generation systems have truly innovative commercial implications. Once again I’m going to refer the more technically adept to one of the prime examples – MXProtocol’s [white paper](https://www.mxc.org/hubfs/WP/MXC_technical_whitepaper.pdf?t=1528200030825).

Our system uses blockchain to monetise M2M transactions in a shared LPWAN network. MXProtocol uses the MXC – a utility token – to facilitate paying for access to whatever LPWAN network is most convenient for your IoT devices. Not necessarily the closest, either. These networks cover huge swathes of the city or countryside, and your devices are likely to be in range of 2 or more hubs at any one time.

So, in this LPWAN sharing economy, each IoT device’s data transmissions have a sort of ‘bid’ attached to it. Let’s say User A is willing to pay 1/100th of a penny to get the data through on a priority basis, perhaps. Maybe User B has ‘bid’ 1/500th of a penny, and a User C has bid 1/20th of a penny for truly high priority data, such as a command to unlock a door or something else human-facing. If all three devices are demanding limited network capacity at once, the protocol sends the high priority data (User C) through first, then the second highest then the third. Everyone can control the priority of their data and only pays for priority when they need it.

When priority prices get too high, well, that means there is profit in opening up a new network! The system regulates itself, whereas demand for the network increases, so does the supply.

So now you see why Low power wide area networks using blockchain for data security and monetization are the solutions of choice for some of the latest smart City projects all around the world. It’s an exciting time for the industry and an exciting time for solutions like the MXProtocol.

I can’t wait to see what happens this year!</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC live on Bibox]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-on-bibox-implementation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-on-bibox-implementation</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC live on Bibox
Last Friday, MXC won Bibox listing vote, finishing first in a very tight competition. MXC will be live on Bibox this Thursday. MXC Co-Founder Aaron Wagener attended a meetup to encourage blockchain companies and enthusiasts to participate in real implementation, not wait for institutions to make the first move.

This is the original script:

Good morning, and welcome to another week of MXC News Update.

As all of our community members would know, last Friday at 6am Berlin Time, we have officially won the 10th round of Bibox Voting. That’s right. That means we finished first on a very tight competition, and soon we will be listed on Bibox going live within 7 days since the voting ended. Thank you for your support, and we will always make sure to deliver the Future of IoT.

Last week, our Co-Founder Aaron Wagener attended a meetup hosted by LongHash Germany and Innogy Innovation Hub, called “Secondary Market Who?”. In an interesting panel of discussions, Aaron suggested that we must not wait for big corporations and institutions to move to implementation and integration. However, to keep the spirit of decentralization, we must be the grassroot that achieves real integration and implementation.

And that’s it for this week’s MXC news update.
The MXC Guy looks forward to talking with all of you next week. Until then, get active, get involved, and ask us questions, because it’s only together that we can build the Future of IoT.

Take care.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our community did something amazing]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/our-community-did-something-amazing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/our-community-did-something-amazing</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Our community did something amazing
Our active MXC community has once again accomplished something amazing. MXC will officially be live on Bibox, the sixth largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. What does this mean for MXC followers?

Listing on multiple exchanges increases liquidity – making it easier to purchase and sell the token. As the MXC token moves over multiple high-level exchanges, it also increases the stability of the token. That’s right. More wallets, more people, more stability.

Of course, as a member of our community, you already knew this! We’re extremely grateful to have such a motivated MXC community, inspired to see MXC listed on multiple top 10 exchanges, in just our first two months as a live token. Here’s a special thanks, and breaking news announcement from our COO and Co-Founder Aaron Wagener.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bibox Voting & Interview with Aaron Wagener]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/bibox-voting-aaron-wagener</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/bibox-voting-aaron-wagener</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Bibox Voting &amp; Interview with Aaron Wagener
MXC is currently on the 10th round of voting on Bibox, staying in the top. We also have a special interview with Co-Founder Aaron Wagener.

MXC CEO Xin Hu represented MXC at DWF, discussing the legality of Blockchain. As the legality of blockchain and cryptocurrency have recently been the hot issue in discussion, MXC participated in discussing the shaping of legal frames.

Original Script:

Welcome to an MXC News Update.

This past week, Co-Founder Xin Hu visited the DWF Blockchain Meetup, where they discussed the legal developments of blockchain within the EU.

The second round of Bibox is underway. MXC is doing extremely well, remaining at the top of the list.

Today we have Co-Founder Aaron Wagener here as a special guest to discuss some of what we have accomplished in 2018, and what to look forward to in 2019.

Aaron: Thanks, Jeff. Great to be here.

Jeff: Aaron, how do you view the new year compared to the last?

Aaron: So last year, we exceeded everyone’s expectations by closing our ICO on evaluation of 40 million dollars in a bear market. Now, if you add to that the free listings on Huobi and Gate, in addition to the world tour in over 15 countries meeting with a lot of IoT enthusiasts, we had a really great year.

Jeff: Leading on from that, what can the community expect in 2019?

Aaron: So in 2019, there’s a lot of work to do. The MXC team is – as I always say – focused on implementation and integration. These are two words we can’t say often enough. It’s something that’s been plaguing the blockchain industry for a long time now: what is the usage of it? How does it help me in my life? And that’s something we intend to roll out as part of the smart city solutions – to get involved in the wider community.

Jeff: Now, there are a lot of projects claiming to be the next generation of cryptocurrency. What is the next generation of cryptocurrency, and what difference do you think it will make in 2019?

Aaron: So what I mean by “the next generation of tokens” is those tokens that stand for true purpose. And that’s one thing at MXC we really pride ourselves on: taking the MXProtocol to the people, getting involved in smart cities so people can see the difference beforehand, and what MXProtocol can do for them in the future.

Jeff: There’s been a lot of discussions going on about the current market conditions. What is your take on that?

Aaron: I mean, the current market condition is very interestingly poised. It’s a bear market, but that doesn’t mean for MXC that the work stops. Quite the opposite, in fact. Now our strategy right now is while others are looking at the bear market, what we are focusing on is implementation and integration – something we’ve been focusing on since day 1 at MXC. We believe that rolling out blockchain solutions to partners will be the future of not just IoT, but the blockchain market.

Jeff: One big goal at MXC is to be the top IoT cryptocurrency. How do you see us accomplishing this?

Aaron: So we are looking at changing people’s lives. To do this, we focus on things such as implementation in New York City, rolling out to the 5 municipalities there, and ensuring that they use the MXProtocol moving forward and really releasing the Future of IoT. Additionally, we are looking at listing on Bibox, and on top of that we will be rolling out new smart city solutions in the coming weeks. We’ll also be meting with IBM, to talk about cooperation between MXC and IBM focusing on A.I and how that can help the data industry. And in the coming weeks, we are really excited to be rolling out a lot of smart city solutions, talking with partners and getting more cooperation going. We are here to change the Future of IoT. Thanks, Jeff. Look forward to joining next time.

Jeff: This has been this week’s MXC News Update. I look forward to talking with all of you again next week. Until then, get active, get in the community, ask us questions because it’s only together we can build the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huobi Korea Listing Event]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/huobi-korea-listing-event</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/huobi-korea-listing-event</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Huobi Korea Listing Event

Welcome to an MXC News update and to the beginning of the end of 2018!

As we go into the new year countdown, we want to share with you some of the key moments from 2018, a quick review of what we accomplished and what’s coming for us in 2019.

MXC began to expand its team in April leading up to a massive MXC Launch Party in July. Our Telegram group exploded with interest as our private sale applicants expressed their enthusiasm for the MXC vision for the Future of IoT.

The Launch Party was a massive success. Co-Founders Xin Hu and Aaron Wagener spoke, joined by our advisors Meinhard Benn and Jeffrey Wernick. This lead into our Global Roadshow, with stops in Singapore, Australia, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo, Shenzhen, Seoul, Taipei, San Jose and New York.1

As steam continued to build for the project, we signed partnerships a number of companies including Fenbushi Capital, BlockAsset Ventures, Longhash, VeChain Foundation, and Node Capital.

Our ICO public sale began on the last day of September, ending early after hitting the hard cap on October 21.

Since then we worked hard on building partnerships for smart city integrations, with our first partnership bringing MXProtocol to New York City in 2019.

All of this was made possible with our active and enthusiastic community.

Thank you for an awesome 2018, and we will see you again in 2019.

Until then, get active, get in the community, ask us questions because after all, we’re here to build the future of IoT together.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXProtocol in NYC and smart cities in 2019]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxprotocol-in-nyc-and-smart-cities-in-2019</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxprotocol-in-nyc-and-smart-cities-in-2019</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXProtocol in NYC and smart cities in 2019

Transcript:

Good morning and welcome to the Christmas edition of the MXC News Update.

On Wednesday we announced that the MXProcotol is on its way to New York City in 2019. Working with Citiesense the MXC Smart City Standard will improve the reliability and efficiency of wireless data transmission in New York City.

Christmas is family time – that means you’re at home, on vacation, and you have a few moments where you’re thinking “what should I do next?” To solve this problem for you we wrote some new content about IoT and smart cities. You can find the links to these blog posts in the description below.

We also have good news for MXC Ambassadors! Over the last couple weeks, we’ve been working hard on building an ambassador kit, not only so that you have a little bit from MXC, but also so you have t-shirts, and goodies to hand out at the meetups and events you’re participating in.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update. I look forward to talking with all of you again next week. Until then eat lots of food, enjoy your food coma, and dream about how we’re going to build the Future of IoT together.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[2019 – A Smarter Year for Smart Cities]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/2019-a-smarter-year-for-smart-cities</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/2019-a-smarter-year-for-smart-cities</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## 2019 – A Smarter Year for Smart Cities
**Some of the amazing things that happened in blockchain technologies in 2018, and what they mean for the coming year**

Now, I’m beginning with the assumption that most of my readers will be a bit puzzled about how blockchain technologies even relate to smart cities, smart homes or even that horrible ‘Google Dot’ thing my daughter is demanding for Christmas. Well, let me explain.

First, we have to define what ‘Smart Cities’ really means for 2019. With a few very notable exceptions (Dubai, Singapore and perhaps Songdo) there really are no truly ‘smart’ cities, nor will there be by the end of 2019. However, we are seeing a great many [‘Smart’ projects](https://www.mxc.org/newsroom/blog/nyc-adopts-smart-city-tech-with-mxprotocol-iot-standard) being rolled out or at least heavily piloted in urban settings all over the world. These are increasingly being addressed under the banner of ‘Smart City Technologies’, and I believe this is for the good.

Rather than a mere watering down of the term, these are the technologies which must be reliably developed before smart cities can form organically, from the ground up rather than being imposed from the top down. The top-down approach was never practical for most of the world’s cities anyway.

## So, ‘Smart City Technologies’ are ‘Those technologies which allow us to automate large parts of everyday life in an urban setting’.
2019 will indeed see more aspects of everyday city life being automated or at least streamlined using these Smart City Technologies. Streetlights that can talk to each other, assessing traffic flows and adjusting their timing to make rush hour less of a nightmare become possible, if not standard. Power grids will be able to configure themselves differently on a hot afternoon in mid-summer than on a breezy day in the autumn. Huge, expensive civil processes can be directed by fewer people, and can become more responsive to actual on-the-scene conditions. The whole process might even make money in the end, rather than cost money.

That last bit sounds a little too utopian, doesn’t it? But read on, it really isn’t out of the question.

## But where does the Blockchain come in?
Well, one thing Dubai, Singapore and Songdo have proven is that the physical technology for smart cites exists, works, and is in some senses of the term economically viable. However, these projects have also shown us that the data created, used and stored by all this automation can be a real stumbling block. It is a huge security problem, and many towns and cities won’t give ‘smart’ infrastructure a second look until it is addressed fully, effectively and with a bit of finality.

That’s where blockchain is coming to the fore. Not as a traded commodity, but as a data collection, routing, use and protection technology.

## What could a smart city deliver for residents?
OK. Let’s really get utopian for a moment. Imagine you live in a ‘proper’ smart city. One with mature, tried and tested technology that has been though all of its wobbles and ‘just works’.

You go into a shoe store. The shop recognised you coming in, perhaps via face recognition, perhaps by your phone’s loyalty app pinging them at the door. The store’s AI queries the city’s database, and in milliseconds knows your shoe size, what styles you tend to like, and how you usually pay. Perhaps an attendant brings examples out for you, or perhaps you tick them off a touch screen. You make your selections and leave, knowing the store and your bank will sort out the money, and your purchase will be delivered in time, perhaps by automated courier.

You get in your car – or perhaps the city sent the nearest car as you finalised your purchases, knowing that it would be the most efficient way to keep traffic moving. You declare your destination, and it whooshes you off without you needing to consciously pay the fare, tolls, or even for parking. You probably have subscriptions services for all of those anyway.

That’s how it could one day work. Not in 2019 (unless you live in Yinchuan, China), but still.

Now let’s get dystopian. Less Star Trek and more Altered Carbon. Imagine how all of that could go badly. I won’t lead you through it – the more pessimistic among you have been doing that since I used the word ‘utopian’, and rightly so.

For all of this to work, it has to use Amazon’s or Google’s approach to monetising your data, but without the overwhelming sinister tone. Point one is data security, and without that there never needs to be a point 2. If visitors and residents don’t have absolute confidence that their data will be collected and stored securely, they won’t fully participate and it all falls apart in a jangled mess of poorly targeted spam and checkout clerks offering you store credit cards at the till.

Now, blockchain can’t address the ethics of the government or the companies involved – that’s still up to you. However, it does offer the possibility of leaping the data security hurdle so that asking the next big set of questions is relevant.

Advances in blockchain technology – such as the MXProtocol, which I’ll address later – are making the IoT streamlined, efficient, decentralised and yet non-hackable. Contracts are becoming unalterable, coded and pre-programmed transactions which happen in an entirely predictable way (better still, a way that doesn’t involve lawyers, beyond the advice you should get before clicking ‘agree’).

## Smart Contracts
I’ve already written about [smart contract technology](https://medium.com/mxc/smart-contracts-oracles-and-the-real-value-of-new-blockchain-currencies-aa9a6a82aeda), but it is worth stressing how the blockchain can be used to make smart contracts work as incorruptible, living documents – self-executing code that aren’t, like traditional contracts “promises to do something and agreements as to what the penalties for breach might be dependent on who has the better lawyers” – they are reliable expressions of what will actually happen and when.

Ethereum, Rootstock, MXC and others have made great strides in making smart contracts secure and practical, and they really are catching on. In America, the US government’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission operates a ‘fintech innovation hub’ called LabCFTC. LabCTFC has just released what they call a ‘[primer on blockchain-enabled smart contract technology’](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/LabCFTC_PrimerSmartContracts112718.pdf). Now, this is no light read, but the future it points to is a very interesting one.

## Paying With Just Your Face
In [Yinchuan](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/10/asia/yinchuan-smart-city-future/index.html), for example, you don’t need ID, a credit card or cash. You can shop with a smile, as facial recognition apps recognise who you are, link to all of your accounts, licenses and permissions securely through blockchain technology, and your purchases get delivered according to the preferences you select with a mobile app.

China is looking into using a host of blockchain technologies to solve their centralised data storage and security problems, and are fine-tuning a ‘national standard plan’ to implement them. The solutions utilising [MXProtocol](https://www.mxc.org/pillars/m2m) and similar technologies could allow the formation of whole ‘smart countries’ made up of ‘smart cities’ and, one assumes, quite a bit of ‘smart countryside’ – though that would require a very robust mobile data infrastructure!

## Passports, Payments and Permissions
Let’s look at Smart Dubai a bit more closely. Whilst they aren’t totally ‘there’ yet, the goal is to drag the UAE kicking and screaming into the 21st century with a completely paperless ‘digital space’where eventually all documents, private and public, will be conducted electronically. This will require the implementation of more than 500 separate initiatives, but they’ve been working on it since 2014, and they’ve made huge advances.

One example is the pilot program whereby goods imported to or exported from Dubai are tracked, shipped and delivered using totally transparent, non-hierarchical and completely reliable blockchain technology. They say it will save more than 25 million man-hours and eliminate something like £1 billion of expenses just by automating the processing of the documents. The fact that the government building s where this was traditionally handles will be all but free from queues is icing on the cake.

Now, let’s look at Estonia. ‘Estonia?’ you might say. Indeed. They suffered a massive cyber-attack in 2007, and started work on a solution. Ever since 2012, Estonia’s commercial, security, legislative, judicial and national health systems have been exchanging data based on distributed ledgers.

Today virtually every Estonian can view and control who accesses their data. They can even challenge illegal or unwanted access. If some city official goes nosing around their records without authorisation, they have undeniable proof, and can prosecute. It actually works, and had for nearly 7 years.

If that sounds like a huge amount of blockchain-secured data whizzing about overhead, it is. But, with next generation LPWAN technical, data use and monetisation solutions like MXProtocol and others this becomes more than practical – it becomes efficient and highly profitable.

## Monetised IoT Networks
I’ve [written about this](https://medium.com/mxc/why-monetisation-of-the-lpwan-network-system-actually-helps-the-sharing-economy-d6120455320d) as well. You can expect to see things happening in the very near future here. With MXC’s recent successful ICO, you’ll see the [MXProtocol](https://www.mxc.org/hubfs/WP/MXC_technical_whitepaper.pdf?t=1528704382872)’s unique monetised gateway system really take off. This is a system whereby you can set the priority of your IoT data on a shared network by effectively bidding for use.

Sound complicated? It’s really not. There is a good video explaining it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26mYsNw32YM).

It’s a bit like Google AdWords. Some of your data must get through straight away. The telemetry form a heart monitor of the signal that tells you a car is being broken into. You bid high, and you pay as much as you actually need to for the priority.

However, some of your data can wait. The daily ping about how frequently the soda machine in the lobby vended a particular soft drink, whilst important for tomorrow’s restocking run, can wait a few minutes for the network to slow down. In that case you bid low, and pay dramatically less. If you’re really interested, you can read more about it on their website’s Use Cases section.

This may not seem as dramatic or world-changing as the other examples, but it is also the kind of technology that actually does change everything. It is a bottom-up approach that is self-funding, effective, practical and will in time make really efficient, self-organising IoT networks huge, sprawling and ubiquitous. Without a foundation like that, smart cities can never really be built.

## So you see, big things really are coming in 2019.
They might not all bear fruit before 2020, but many of them will, and the rest won’t be far behind. Keep an eye on currencies like MXC and Ethereum which are built to be tied into smart contracts, and look out for massive, multi-user LPWAN solutions for the next generation IoT as well.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC to make Smart City New York]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-smart-city-new-york</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-smart-city-new-york</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC to make Smart City New York
## A Millenia Old Problem
There has been one problem that has been around as long as the history of the entire humanity: waste management.
Even though the type of waste may have changed, the problem still persists today and has grown on an exponential scale. Currently, New York City produces about 14 million tons of trash per year. It’s no wonder the Concrete Jungle tends to receive a bad reputation from other cities around the world.

## The Trash Dictates The System And The System Is Trash
With the introduction of garbage collection and garbage trucks, New York City has been tackling the rather stinky problem on its streets. However, the traditional system of set routes of garbage trucks at set times on routine is what drives down the quality of urban life. Every morning, New Yorkers are rudely wakened up with the sound of garbage trucks. In an early morning commute, frustration rises as rows of cars are stuck behind a garbage truck. Yet, in the evening, the garbage bins on the street seem to be teeming to the brim with waste. So what’s the solution?

## Smart Garbage Bin And Collection
Through collaboration with [Citisense](https://www.citiesense.com/), MXC is putting smart sensors on garbage bins around New York City. The sensor utilizes ultrasound to measure the fill level of each garbage bin, which is transmitted to waste management companies through the MXProtocol that operates on LPWAN. Each sensor can be pre-set to send the alert when the bins are 80% full, ensuring that no overflow of waste onto the streets.
That means garbage collection when it’s needed, rather than when it’s scheduled. Hence, resources can be better allocated to target areas with heavy foot traffic, at ideal times to avoid commuting traffic. No more foul-smelling alarms in the morning, and no more frustration on the road. That’s greener and smarter New York City.

## Empowering Citizens and Businesses
A demand-based system of garbage collection breaks away from the traditional schedule-based system, which often has been the subject of discrimination. Certain areas of New York City lacks frequent garbage collection, while other areas experience a large abundance of it. Hence, Smart City New York – driven by MXC and Citiesense – is now fairer and inclusive.
Citizens can also take part in providing the necessary infrastructure for MXProtocol. They can deploy their own LPWAN Gateways around the city, providing essential connection points for MXProtocol to run, and thus earning MXC as passive income.
Waste Management businesses can also benefit from MXProtocol. As they collect almost-full garbage bins, they also passively collect data about waste levels in certain areas. This precious data can be sold on an open data market to other companies or institutions that require such data – ensuring authentic field data at a fraction of the current price, and an additional source of income for the businesses that collected the data.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[NYC Adopts MXProtocol IoT Standard]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/nyc-adopts-mxprotocol</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/nyc-adopts-mxprotocol</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## NYC Adopts MXProtocol IoT Standard
**Berlin, Germany, December 19, 2018** — Berlin-based Blockchain non-profit MXC, announced the launch of their “Smart City IoT Standard”, the MXProtocol, in New York City in cooperation with matchx.io and [Citiesense](https://www.citiesense.com/). The 2019 NYC Smart City Program will see hundreds of Smart Sensors &amp; LPWAN Gateways deployed across the business districts in NYC. These high tech sensors will manage local assets and collect data to optimize waste management by using detailed data to reduce operational cost and decrease traffic congestion; improving local residents’ quality of life.

“This is a big day for New Yorkers and for the future of IoT,” said MXC Co-Founder [Aaron Wagener](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-wagener-0424821/). “Using the MXProtocol and the insights of Citiesense we’re significantly increasing data reach and efficiency, ultimately improving the lives of all citizens throughout the city.”

“Data has the potential to massively improve efficiency and reduce our environmental impact around the globe,” said [Starling Childs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/star-childs-3935603/), CEO of Citiesense. “By incorporating the LPWAN standard, we’re ensuring that data is transmitted both reliably and efficiently.”

“LPWAN is the most energy efficient and reliable technology for wireless transmissions in smart cities,” said Xin Hu, CEO of MatchX. “This joint partnership will function as the model for future smart city integrations.”

2019 is expected to usher in a “new wave” in Blockchain technology, with a clear focus on integration and real-world implementation. With more international cities expected to roll out throughout 2019, MXC is focusing on giving Blockchain a true purpose within the IoT world.

The MXC Foundation is a purpose-built non-profit with the mission to inspire fast, efficient, decentralized data exchanges using LPWAN and Blockchain technology. The MXC team believes that MXC paired with LPWAN is the next step in the fourth industrial revolution, creating a Smart City Standard for the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC travels to Frankfurt Oder and Hong Kong]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/viadrina-and-hong-kong</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/viadrina-and-hong-kong</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC travels to Frankfurt Oder and Hong Kong
Jeff and MXC1 traveled to European University Viadrina. Our ambassador Calvin presented MXC in Hong Kong! This and more in this week’s MXC News Update.

Welcome to an MXC News Update!

This week brought the first internal release of the MXC wallet, and if I may share my personal opinion on it, it looks beautiful. I’d be excited to share that with you!

It’s not quite ready for public release. There’s still quite a bit of work to be done on it, but when it is, I look forward to sharing it with all of you.

MXC1 and myself travel to the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt Oder. There we shared with them the wonders of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and of course, the beauty of MXC.
The students were very excited! There was a very long Q&amp;A session, and we look forward to working with them further as they test out the technology.

MXC Ambassador Calvin traveled to Hong Kong for an event, where he presented MXC to over 80 people. His enthusiasm for MXC was contagious!
There was a lot of good feedback. Great job, Calvin!

For those of you looking to become an MXC ambassador, don’t forget we rate these applications not only on the application itself, but also on your activity in the MXC community.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update.

I look forward to talking with all of you again next week. Until then, get active, get in the community, and ask us questions, because it’s only together that we can build the future of IoT.

The past week was as busy as ever. MXC is live on 3 exchanges and now can be traced on Coin Stats and Coin Market Cap. MXC attended the Stellar meetup and was invited to EIT Digital Innovation Day to talk about MXC and its implications on Blockchain – A.I collaboration.

Here is the original transcript:

Hello and welcome to an MXC News Update.

What an exciting week! We are now live on Huobi, Cybex, and Gate, and you can also find us on Coin Stats and even Coin Market Cap.

Motivated by the excitement in our community, both Huobi and Gate are running competitions for you to win MXC.

On Huobi, they’re giving away 3.5 Million MXC. To get a piece of this 3.5 Million, all you have to do is trade more than 10,000 MXC on Huobi. This competition is running until December 13th.

On Gate.io, you also can win MXC by trading, but there’s another component where you can just share the competition on social media, and get a chance to win a portion of this MXC as well.

Together combined, this is over 7 Million MXC being given away! You don’t want to miss out!

So head over to Huobi or Gate to participate.

On Wednesday night, members of our team joined the Stellar meetup in Berlin. There were a lot of interesting stuff being discussed, including an intriguing way for rapid transactions on Stellar blockchain.

We were also intrigued by the new Stellar wallet being presented at the meetup, though personally, I don’t think anything can compare to the new MXC Wallet being developed right now.

On Friday, MXC CEO Sheen Hu attended EIT DIgital’s 2018 Innovation Day in Berlin. There, he was joined by a number of European A.I innovators to talk about the importance of A.I in digital innovation. Sheen also gave a presentation about MXC and how the massive amount of data on the MXC platform can be used in an A.I innovation.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update. I look forward to talking with all of you next week.

Until then, get in the community, get active, ask us questions, because it’s only together that we can build the Future of IoT.

MXC1)
In this week’s MXC News Update, MXC Data Analyst and Developer Aslan heads to Data Native Conference. Co-Founder Aaron Wagener continues to work towards Smart City integration, while the developers make progress on MXC integration. Siwon Kim (MXC1) talks about the MXC Content Bounty program.

Original Script:

Welcome to an MXC News Update!

MXC Data Scientist and Developer Aslan Mehrabi visited the Data Native Conference in Berlin.

The discussions there centered around data and how blockchain not only influences data privacy, but provides the ideal platform for a data shared economy.

Co-Founder Aaron Wagener continues to follow-up on some key conversations he had at the Smart City World Congress. It’s looking good for smart city integrations. Of course, more will be released on this in the coming months.

Our development team is busy working on the next phase of MXC integration. Currently, they are still working on the MXC Wallet. However, they will soon be diving deeper into the MXProtocol itself. The full overview of what we’re currently working on, is available in the MXC Timeline.

MXSiwon finished reviewing the Community Bounty submissions. Here’s a short interview I had with him earlier today.

Jeff: How was it?

Siwon: It was quite a different experience. I was very happy to read all the bounties.

We created 950 tracking links, and out of those we had about 466 submissions, and out of those we had about 150 contents to review. I was the one who was manually reading through a lot of the contents. Which was actually a lot of learning opportunity for me also, because I can have a better understanding of what other people are taking and understanding from our website.

Also, there were some amazing contents out there that also taught me a lot about how these applications work in their native countries, in their native hometown and universities and so on. So those were the contents that I was very happy to read about.

Jeff: And is there anything you critique from this experience that you would want to recommend to anybody else looking at doing content bounty?

Siwon: So I think the very first is that they have to understand that the moment they agree to participate, there is a standard of quality that we are looking for. It is something that we’re holding everyone to a standard at a fair game. We are trying to be fair to everyone. So I think for everyone who participated, if they are looking towards future bounty contents, then they need to understand that they need to read through the rules, and make sure that what they are submitting is on par with the rules.

And of course, another thing I can add is, nothing is personal. We are holding people to all equal standards. So, don’t get offended. When they get offended, then it makes me more sad. And it just makes the job a little more difficult.

Jeff: Alright, well thank you, Siwon.

Siwon: Thank you, Jeff.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update. I look forward to speaking with you again next week.

Until then, get in the community, get active, ask us questions because it’s only together that we can build the Future of IoT.

Insurance policies are purchased for peace of mind. Yet, only around 50% of consumers trust insurers to pay out. The message from inside the industry is to build trust with consumers. However there is a better solution.

The blockchain.

This disruptive technology provides forward-thinking solutions that protect consumers and insurers. As the architecture of blockchain technology improves, there is more demand from consumers for companies to adopt new technologies and more incentives for companies to accelerate the paradigm shift.

A decentralised public ledger that can revolutionise corporate protocols is at the forefront of consumer thinking — especially in the younger generations. [Surveys reveal](https://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/only-half-of-british-consumers-trust-insurance-companies-to-pay-claims/1425151.article) that 16–29 year olds are the demographic that have the least trust in insurance companies.

The cross over to digital platforms calls for improved systems that can facilitate privacy and security when sharing financial data. With is highly complex nature, the insurance industry would be a major beneficiary of blockchain technology.

The opportunity to create peer-to-peer policies that have real value, and that consumers can trust, is huge. Public ledgers are transparent, self-policed and incorruptible.

The benefit for consumers is they would be able to buy insurance and have peace of mind they will be compensated without qualifying causes that are unjust. For insurance companies the incentive ins to reduce fraudulent claims and process damages more speedily.

Everyones a winner.

## Smart Contracts
Public ledgers effectively remove intermediaries and are replaced by a digital agreement known as a [smart contract](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/). In short, a smart contract ensures that all parties involved in the transaction fulfil their obligation. Smart contracts could effectively replace lawyers.

Peer-to-peer ledgers take contracts to the next level; new approaches in underwriting, claims management and public scrutiny will overhaul the current methods of operation.

In the current climate, the [input from various parties slows down the claims management process](https://www.pwc.ch/en/publications/2017/Xlos_Etude_Blockchain_UK_2017_Web.pdf). Insurers are also reliant on accurate data in order to calculate damages that claimants are entitled to, the risk checks for adjusters can be extremely varied and time-consuming.

There are some forms of insurance that will still require a lot of data from outside a blockchain. A car accident or burglary for example. However, the data needed to execute a smart contract for many other types of claims can be easily verified by information from other devices within the blockchain.

For example, if you sell holiday insurance and compensate for delayed or cancelled flights, you won’t have to contact the airline or verify the information. Blockchain has an “oracle” which has already recorded the information.

These hardware oracles collect data from a wide range of connected devices and track events. However, this feature of the blockchain can only be effective on a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).

An LPWAN is akin to radio technology that is wirelessly capable of long-range communication. The network is able to transfer data from multiple connected devices and is a [key component for the future of IoT](https://www.mxc.org/blog/revealing-the-future-of-iot-the-machine-exchange-coin).

## Peer-to-Peer Insurance
Smart contracts represent the first level of a decentralised process, but has benefits on a number of levels. Although contracts will still be drafted by insurance companies, and brands in general, smart contracts on a blockchain can interact with other relevant contracts and contribute to an “open network enterprise”.

In an open network, contracts will be efficiently overviewed by autonomous programs without the need for human input. A public ledger is vital here as it removes the potential for private companies to include clauses that do not benefit consumers.

As more contracts are created, the blockchain has more information to determine which policies favour consumers. P2P insurance policies can therefore be rolled out on a large scale which increases competition amongst insurers and creates better deals for consumers.

## Fraud Detection
Blockchain is not only customer-focused. Public ledgers are incorruptible. Once data has been transferred and recoded in the digital library, it cannot be tampered with by either party. A decentralised repository detects fraudulent activity and eliminates the potential for human error.

Many [insurance companies are already exploring blockchain technology](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-insurance-disruption/) with a view to implementing a structure that reduces the risk of fraud.

For example, in specialty insurance and reinsurance markets where insurers are removed by end-clients, there is a higher risk of receiving duplicate claims. Blockchain eliminates the inefficiencies of poor quality data by validating and verifying data that has already been processed.

## Risk Prevention
Blockchain technologies on LPWAN will also reduce the risk for insurers and help to process claims quicker. Long range data streams allows insurers to combine location-based data, external risk and analytics against various third party data.

The capacity to instantly access and update relevant information such as claims forms, police reports, device usage, weather reports etc, will not only streamline the claims process and cut the costs involved in assessing claims, but will also apply validity to a claimants application.

Data taken from relevant sources within a vast network of blockchains enhances data sharing and allows for advanced automation and stronger safeguards against illicit claims.

## IoT Integration
The long term goals for insurance companies is to integrate blockchain components that allow for widespread communication among connected devices. As we stand at the intersection of big data and IoT, the blockchain combines the two and can provide high-stakes value proposition for insurers and their customers.

Consider how sensors installed with software fitted to hardware can deliver near-field information in real-time. On blockchain’s that use LPWAN, that data can be used to alert insurers that are tapped into a broader network of information resources.

For example, a sensor fitted to a car together can notify insurers that a vehicle has been involved in a road traffic accident. A new claim can be set up without claimants having to contact you first. Satellite footage and road-side cameras can also be used to determine which party was at fault for the accident.

To up the game, insurers could even arrange for an immediate response by notifying police, medical teams and towing services. Drones can be dispatched to assess the damage. By improving customer services and customer satisfaction, insurance companies have the opportunity to earn trust among consumers.

Numerous financial services are tentatively adopting blockchain. Although still in the infant stages, the technology has huge potential. The insurance industry is a prime candidate that can benefit from blockchain technologies but will also rely on systems that incorporate LPWAN as well such a MXC.

To borrow a marketing slogan: the future looks bright.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Standard takes on World Blockchain Forum]]></title><description><![CDATA[The past week was full of travels in MXC, as MXC Standard was revealed at World Blockchain Forum in New York, and as MXC continued to generate more movement towards becoming the Smart City IoT Standard in both Barcelona and Berlin.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/blockchain-smart-city-beta-pitch-global</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/blockchain-smart-city-beta-pitch-global</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Standard takes on World Blockchain Forum
The past week was full of travels in MXC, as MXC Standard was revealed at World Blockchain Forum in New York, and as MXC continued to generate more movement towards becoming the Smart City IoT Standard in both Barcelona and Berlin.

Welcome to MXC New Update.

MXC Co-Founder and CEO, Xin Hu, traveled to New York. There he participated in the World Blockchain Forum. He both exhibited and presented the MXC Standard for Smart Cities and the Future of IoT. He also joined a panel on how Blockchain technology will affect the future of data privacy, security, and ownership.

Co-Founder and COO, Aaron Wagener, was also traveling. Here’s a clip from him about the event:

[Aaron] Hi from Smart City World Congress in Barcelona. We’ve been presenting MXC to a lot of different cities around the globe. We’re looking forward to getting MXProtocol implemented and truly used for its true benefit. Can’t wait to tell you more. Thanks for joining this mission. Take care.

We were also invited to Betahaus to meet with a number of potential partners from all around Europe. Some of our conversations included Smart City solutions for Slovenia, and asset management for a global company. We look forward to speaking more about these opportunities in the coming weeks.

The construction of Smart Cities is an innovation that is already underway. Yet the technology we need is not in place. While government and corporate policy makers forge ahead with sub-standard technologies, the general public are being set up for more disappointment.

Furthermore, we will have to pay to correct the mess.

The complexity of digitally operated infrastructures is the stuff of science fiction; but innovators are on the brink of implementing solutions that are equitable, scalable and sustainable.

A blend of blockchain technology and the vast range of connectable devices associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) is a cocktail that will lay the foundations to build cities storytellers associate with the 21st Century.

Ever since mankind began building cities, the innovation of technology has been the driving force behind change. Ramps, pulleys and the wheel were instrumental in ancient constructs. Cities were built by manpower and sheer ingenuity.

In that sense, little has changed. However, the ingenuity of the modern age is to resolve the first-world problems of city living; traffic congestion, polluted air, expensive transportation and a lack of space.

Yet these are not the only problems we will face when the development of Smart Cities starts in earnest. A report titled, ‘[The Future of Equity in Cities](https://nlc.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Future%20of%20Equity%20in%20Cities%202017.pdf)’ published by the National League of Cities raises the potential issue of deepening inequality within the economic and social construct of urban communities.

Cities are directly impacted by social structures of equity through political policy and public opinion. While innovation can create a buzz in the build-up to change, if the technology and services that are available in the upgrade is not economically viable for low-income workers, the buzz loses its energy and the city is at risk of becoming destabilised.

Blockchain innovators hold the keys to smart cities

As the integration of Smart Cities begins to become more visible, the positive changes become apparent. Analytical reports spark upbeat conversations among influential leaders and commentators, and the idea is sold to the rest of us through the media.

However, it is important that innovators, policy makers and money men do not lose sight of promoting equity, sustainability and equality. This level of initiative also has to reach beyond the infrastructure of a Smart City and look for solutions that allow public of all income levels to improve their quality of life.

History shows that the ruling classes are always the winners of innovation. Even in the wake of economical and social destruction, [policy makers accrue wealth](https://fortune.com/2013/09/11/the-rich-got-a-lot-richer-since-the-financial-crisis/) whilst the average joe pays for it. How much should we trust policymakers to build new cities?

It is well documented that the blockchain shows a lot of promise in the story of Smart Cities. ICO’s have plans that can genuinely improve the quality of life for everyone. The hope and ambition within the cryptocurrency community is for digital tokens, smart contracts and other technological innovations to be incorruptible and give more power to the public.

This is the Utopian dream at least. The established banking industry may yet have their say. Major banks are already developing blockchain applications and there is talk of [ten banks creating their own cryptocurrency](https://sputniknews.com/business/201709031057049475-new-cryptocurrency-banks/).

Needless to say, if the bank’s create digital tokens it will spell the end game for honest ICO’s. The public ledger will take a backseat in the governance of the financial system. If the general public really want change, we have to back independent cryptocurrencies that care for the future of our societies as a whole.

Ethereum, Ripple, Machine eXchange Coin et al need you! Back the honest guys, not the banks.

How MXC can ensure equity in Smart Cities

The blockchain has the potential to ensure the cost of living in the cities of the future are equitable, yet affordable. Whilst the infrastructure of smart cities will take time to develop, IoT innovation already exists in some countries.

Cryptocurrencies accommodate the implementation of cost-effective payment gateways, transparency and reduced costs. By cutting out the middle man there are no admin charges or conversion fees to pay, and, in theory, the financial markets cannot be manipulated.

Not only that, but cryptocurrencies such as MXC do not charge fees for services or transactions and all gateway fees are minimal compared to rival third party options. The company is also utilising a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) which will dramatically slash fees for end-users.

[IoT cannot work effectively without LPWAN](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405959517302953). The current infrastructure that is dominated by Telecommunication brands are expensive and guzzle energy. In the new world, these old technologies will soon become outdated.

Large scale development that will facilitate public transportation systems, traffic congestion and reduce energy consumption is reliant on IoT. City leaders that mention equity is part of their planning can also rely on LPWAN to move forward with their environmental goals and reduce greenhouse gases.

A Smart City where energy sources are completely renewable rely on low power networks. Collecting and sharing data through wi-fi hotspots that feed into the blockchain will enables cities to operate efficiently but requires a wide area network to channel data from multiple devices.

Sensors embedded into street lights, water supplies, electricity and gas meters provide accurate data that helps decision makers organise their city planning. In order to build a healthy and sustainable place to live and work without today’s expense is the only solution to rising inflation and the gulf between the wealthy and the pithy.

IoT and the blockchain have the potential to make a real change within city communities, and the ripple effect will be felt further afield. Technological development can enhance the experience of urban living, but policy makers have to be mindful not to allow low-income earners to fall further behind.

This is where blockchain and forward-thinking innovations like MXC can really make the difference. Critical information is shared, and can be acted upon, by decision makers among the general public, and not policy makers that act in the best interests of high-income earners.

Smart Cities require smart thinking and supporting initiatives that care about the community is where smart people channel their energies. From today, let’s make a promise to be smart about how we create the cities of the future.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ambassador Program, MXC Cortex, Huobi Global]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC Ambassador Program, introducing the MXC Cortex and MXC to be on three exchanges.

[Join our Discord (limited to ten users)](https://discord.com/invite/RHv2ENP)
MXC Ambassador Program: Coming Soon!

**Original Script:**

Welcome to an MXC News Update!

## Hard Cap Reached
Our week started with the public sale, which ended rapidly on Sunday when we hit the hard cap. That’s right, MXC hit the hard cap during a bear market. Once again, thank you to all of our supporters who participated in the public sale.

## MXC AXS Development Underway
With the public sale over, our development team is working hard on the MXC AXS. In the meantime, we continue to build partnerships around the globe with a variety of companies and cities. We’ll announce these throughout the next few months.

## MXC Ambassador Program
Many of our community members have approached us and asked us if we plan to have a presence in their country. The answer is. Yes! No matter where you live, we plan to have a presence there!

To achieve this, early next week we will launch the MXC Ambassador program. This gives people who truly believe in MXC the opportunity to attend Crypto and IoT events, host MXC Meetups and even speak for MXC . Ambassadors will also receive ongoing rewards for producing content about MXC and moderating the MXC Community. I will add a link to the ambassador program below in the description, once the page goes live.

## MXC Discord Open
As conversations in Telegram turn towards the technology, we decided to find a platform better suited for topic-specific conversations. Therefore we are launching an MXC discord server, dedicated to MXC and IoT. At this time we are inviting 10 community members to join our discord, interact with our team and provide feedback. To join – use the link in the video description below. Again – this URL will only work for the first 10 people who sign up.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update! I look forward to talking to you all again next week. Until then, get active, be in the community, ask us questions because after all, we’re here to build the future of IoT together.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Public Sale is over, we'll see you on Huobi]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/public-sale-over-huobi</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/public-sale-over-huobi</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Public Sale is over, we’ll see you on Huobi
MXC won the Huobi Next competition, gaining Huobi as a supporter and a free listing on Huobi. Our public sale is over! On Friday at 5 PM we ended the public sale. Special thanks to all of our supporters!

**Original Script:**

## MXC wins Huobi Next Challenge
On Wednesday MXC won the Huobi Next contest guaranteeing us a listing on Huobi Global. Huobi BD Director Elaine Du said that MXC is one of the only challengers to win within 13 minutes. She also said that people believe in MXC, and the team’s ability to build the foundation for the future of IoT.

## Public Sale Closed Early
The Huobi results spurred massive interest in the MXC Public sale, forcing us to close the sale early. That’s right, the MXC allocation for the public sale is gone, having ended today at 5 PM CEST. A big thanks go out to all of you who participated in the Public Sale. Our goal is to send you your MXC Allocation in November – however, we only guarantee that you will receive it within 90 days from today.

## Content Bounty Ongoing
If you missed the ICO, you still have a chance to get MXC. The MXC Content Bounty will continue until October 31. All the detail about this program are available at www.mxc.org/bounty

For those of you who are new to MXC, I’m Jeff the MXC Guy and once a week I put together a short news briefing for you about what we’ve been doing at MXC. This will, of course, continue past the ICO as we develop the MXProtocol, sign MOUs and promote the global adoption of LPWAN technology. We will also continue the MXC for Beginners series, covering more elements of MXC and LPWAN.

This has been this week’s MXC News Update! I look forward to talking to you all again next week. Until then, get active, be in the community, ask us questions. We’re here to build the future of IoT together.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huobi Global Chooses MXC as IoT Token]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC Foundation, the break-through cryptocurrency promoting LPWAN technology powered by the MXProtocol, today announced that they won the Huobi Next competition in fewer than 13 minutes, gaining Huobi Global as an investor, and a listing on the Huobi cryptocurrency exchange.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/huobi-global-mxc-iot-token</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/huobi-global-mxc-iot-token</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Huobi Global Chooses MXC as IoT Token
MXC Foundation, the break-through cryptocurrency promoting LPWAN technology powered by the MXProtocol, today announced that they won the Huobi Next competition in fewer than 13 minutes, gaining Huobi Global as an investor, and a listing on the Huobi cryptocurrency exchange.

“The entire team at MXC is excited to receive the backing of such an influential exchange,” said MXC Co-Founder Aaron Wagener. “Winning this competition and thereby gaining the support of Huobi spawned from our truly unique approach to solving real business challenges and taking Blockchain to the people.”

Huobi Global is one of the world’s leading digital asset trading platforms, offering trading and investment in over 100 digital asset pairs. Listing on a digital trading platform like Huobi provides more people access to MXC. This is essential in the lifecycle of a cryptocurrency as it enables more people to purchase and use MXC to pay for LPWAN network access or participate in the MXC interchain data market.

“MXC is one of the only challengers to win the Huobi Next competition within 13 minutes, ” said Elaine Du, Huobi BD director. “This really shows that the people believe in MXC, and that the MXC team is able to bring their vision for the future of IoT to fruition.”

Huobi Global is the newest of many investors including LongHash, VeChain, Quarkchain, Fenbushi, and NodeCapital who strongly believe in MXC’s vision for the Future of IoT.

MXC adds the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol) to LPWAN technologies, solving the problem of data-collision and creating a platform for the monetization of individually owned LPWAN networks and data collected via these networks. Owners of this data can then trade it as a data set or live stream using the MXC Interchain Data Market or Web API. This provides more people with access to large data sources and enables the general public to participate and profit from data.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Public Sale, Quarkchain, Huobi Next]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/public-sale-quarkchain-hardware-huobi</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/public-sale-quarkchain-hardware-huobi</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Public Sale, Quarkchain, Huobi Next

**Original Script:**

Hello and welcome to another MXC Guy News Update!

## KYC and ICO
This week started at a sprint. As KYC applications and ICO contracts kept rolling in, it’s taking much of our effort to keep up with the demand! It’s been exciting to see so many people involved with and interested in MXC.

While working to keep up with KYC and KYC related questions, Aaron and Sheen participated in a live AMA in the Quarkchain Telegram group. There they answered a few great questions!

## MXC knows Hardware
One such question asked about our expertise in LPWAN.

Yes – much of the team comes from an IoT and hardware background. It was while working with LoRa LPWAN technology that the need for MXC became apparent, not only to increase the reliability of data transmission but also to provide an incentive for the massive launch and adoption of low power, wide area networks.

Vote for MXC on Huobi Next
You can get MXC placed on Huobi! The next round of Huobi Next voting will end on October 16. Until then you have a chance to motivate your friends, family and professional network to vote for a Future of IoT that they can, in turn, profit from. It’s really simple.

Learn about MXC in the first video of the “Beginner’s Guide to MXC” series. In this video, Aaron answers the questions “What is MXC?” by describing the 3-pillars of MXC; machine-to-machine communication, network allocation, and interchain data trade.

*Video Transcript “What is MXC”*
Welcome to MXC for Beginners! So what is MXC? MXC is an IoT token with three pillars: machine-to-machine communication, network allocation, and the interchain data trade network.

Firstly, machine-to-machine communication. We’re allowing devices, or things, to communicate with each other without any human interaction.

The second pillar of MXC is what we call network allocation. Literally allowing anybody to get involved in MXC by setting up their own device data network. People use your device data network, you earn MXC, and become part of the shared economy.

The third pillar of MCX is the interchain data trade market. We’re making it easy for you to buy, sell, or trade device data. Everything from air quality, energy consumption, or even soil moisture detection. At MXC we know device data is valuable. Now we’re putting the power back in your hands, so you can earn from your data.

That was the beginner’s guide to MXC – stay tuned to learn more about MXC, the Future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[EIT Digital, the Great Move, and HADAX]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/eit-digital-and-hadax</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/eit-digital-and-hadax</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## EIT Digital, the Great Move, and HADAX

There are many organizations competing to make the most out of the Internet of Things using LPWAN technology. At this point, there is so much being said about the technology that I thought it would be best to write a guide establishing exactly what LPWAN is, what it can do, and how a few companies are actively pushing those limits.

## First, what is ‘LPWAN’ anyway?
LPWAN stands for ‘Low Power, Wide Area Network’. (LPWA and LPN mean exactly the same thing, by the way.) It is a type of wide area network that allows radio-equipped devices to communicate. WANs are simply telecommunications networks. The system of cell phone towers and 5G you rely on every day is a WAN. So is the internet, if you want to get technical. You could form an Internet of things WAN using 5G technology, or even landline broadband. However, unless your device has a mains plug, you’re going to run out of battery power very very fast that way. Instead, the future of large scale, low maintenance, widely dispersed IoT applications will be found in LOW POWER wireless WANS – LPWANs.

LPWANs use wireless communications to link devices together over very long ranges using very low power signals. Their chief drawback is that they have a painfully slow bit rate compared to Wi-Fi or mobile data networks. Few LPWANs can manage even 1 Mbit per second per channel, and the slowest operate at around 100 bits per second. This drawback is acceptable because they really are low-power applications. Many LPWANS connect battery-operated sensors that are miles apart and have to run for years between battery changes to be practical.

LPWANs can be developed and fielded on a private level, but that requires setting up your own gateway, something we’ll talk about later. One of the technologies, MXProtocol, encourages third parties to set up gateways, and allow sensor owners or operators to use their networks on a commercial basis. This is one place where we’re seeing most of the really fascinating innovations.

## So, there is a convenient, universal LPWAN protocol, right?
Heh. Have you ever met an electronics engineer? Alas, no. There are a number of competing protocols. That can cause confusion and a bit of unnecessary duplication, but it also allows for the technology to differentiate, doing different things very well.

There are two broad categories of LPWAN protocols: Cellular and Non-Cellular. Cellular LPWAN systems use licensed cellular frequencies – the same signal range our phones use – and Non-Cellular systems do not. Instead, they use the ISM radio bands set aside for ‘industrial, scientific and medical’ use, which are not licensed at all.

## Popular Cellular LPWAN protocols include:
- EC-GSM-IoT
- LTE-M (also called LTE Cat-M1 and Cat-M1)
- NB-IoT (also called Cat-M2)
Of these, perhaps the most popular is **LTE-M**, which uses smartphone infrastructure, making it a very wide network indeed. The ‘M’ is standing in for MTC (Machine Type Communication) over the LTE standard cell phone infrastructure. LTE-M networks operate at the high end in terms of bitrate at up to 1 Mbps.

Telecoms providers can make LTE-M LPWAN gateways out of their cellular towers by adding a bit of software – no new hardware needed. Verizon, AT&amp;T and Bell have already started rolling out gateways.

**NB-IoT** stands for Narrowband Internet of Things, and it does just what it sounds like. It has perhaps a quarter the maximum bitrate of the LTE-M systems at around 250 kbps, and it does not use the LTE in the same way mobile devices do. It relies on DSSS modulation instead. It can be used on LTE bands, or on GSM bands at around 180 kHz.

NB-IoT, interestingly, does not require a gateway. Devices can send data directly to the server, if the other physical and data infrastructure is in place. It is also considered a very reliable protocol, so it is preferred for high priority monitoring applications. It also requires dramatically less power to operate than LTE-M.

This standard is more popular in Europe than in the US, and is held back perhaps by a lack of investment. There are not a great many Narrowband chipsets manufactured, and that keeps the cost per unit fairly high. Rumor has it that more are on the horizon, though, so this may change.

Last but not least, let’s look at **EC-GSM-IoT**. This mouthful of alphabet soup stands for Extended Coverage Global System for Mobile IoT. It works over the GPRS (General packet Radio Service) band. Any GSM network can run the protocol, so long as it is running the software.

Compared to the other 2 ‘big’ standards, EC-GSM-IoT is not very popular with users or developers. I’m not saying that’s BECAUSE it has a lousy name, but come on… that name is awful.

## Non-cellular LPWAN protocols include:
LoRa (including both LoRaWAN and Symphony Link)
MXProtocol
Ingenu (also called RPMA)
Sigfox
Weightless (including Nwave and Weightless-p)
Of these, LoRaWAN is the best known. It is put out by the LoRa Alliance, a collection of more than 500 companies including real influencers like IBM, Cisco, and Alibaba. Note that the LoRaWAN specification is publicly available to developers, but the core LoRa technology is proprietary, and royalties are paid on every chip sold.

To use **LoRaWAN**, you’ll need the whole kit – servers, switches, access points, and gateways. The good news in that many of those 500 companies sells individual items such as gateways and servers. On one level this can be a hassle, but it ensures that you have complete control over your network and can configure it any way you like.

LoRa systems can support up to 222 bytes which are not huge but does offer some flexibility. It can even carry over the air updates if you’re patient enough. It runs at 915 MHz in the US and 869 in Europe.

**LoRAWAN with MXProtocol** the MXProtocol uses an advanced anti-collision coordinator to allow really massive IoT networks with thousands or even tens of thousands of devices using 2-way communication over many square miles of geographical territory. It does this by making it possible for gateways with overlapping areas to coordinate transmissions.

MXProtocol has 4 major features that it adds to LoRaWAN networks:

It minimizes packet collisions across multiple networks:

- It can reallocate resources on the fly between different networks
- It allows the use of extra-network resources to be magnetized – essentially allowing ‘network roaming’ for LoRaWAN sensors
- It creates a monetization system using cryptocurrency (the Machine eXchange Coin)
They have a white paper online that covers all of the details.

**Symphony Link** uses the LoRa PHY layer but does everything else itself. It never really took off, not because there was anything wrong with it but because the LoRa Alliance juggernaut was too much to compete with. These days Link Labs is focusing on developing IoT apps.

**Sigfox** is the oldest standard on the ISM band, and also runs at 915 and 869 MHz. It essentially created the category. It is widespread, having networks in nearly 5 countries already and plans to expand to 60 before the end of 2018.

Sigfox is unique that they own and operate the infrastructure, and charge users/owners to send data. It is inexpensive, in general. If your devices only send a handful of messages a day, you’ll end up paying just a few dollars a year for the service. Sigfox does not charge royalties to chip vendors and makes much of their IP freely available. After all, they want you to design devices that use their system.

On the downside, each Sigfox message is limited to a minuscule 12 bytes. You also have to wait for them to set up a network for you. However, if you can pare your signals down to a dozen 1s and 0s and you can work to their schedule, it is an infrastructure-free option with good security and low power needs.

**Ingenu (RPMA)** runs on the same band that carries Bluetooth and Wi-Fi – 2.4 GHz. This band is available all over the world, which is a significant advantage. It is also a wider band overall.

Ingenu’s Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA) system is both a PHY and MAC layer. It allows Ingenu networks to do some very interesting things, like deliver half a million messages per hour across 176 square miles with a single gateway. Their transmitters can go 10 to 20 years (estimated, of course) on a single battery, and some of the first ones installed are still chirping away happily today.

The system offers features that Ingenu would like to see made LPWA standards – broadcast capability, authentication, a responsive network, flexible packet size, delivery acknowledgment and even full 2-way communication with IoT devices.

Ingenu’s Machine Network currently covers more than 100,000 square miles of territory in 30 countries (as well as 30 cities within the US). They are making moves to offer the RPMA on a platform as a service (PaaS) basis as well.

Then we have the **Weightless LPWAN** standard. Weightless operates on potentially any sub-GHz ISM band from 163 MHz to 923 MHz. These are all unlicensed, of course.

Weightless-N, Weightless-W, and Weightless-P were all offered by the Weightless Special Interest Group, but N and W have been all but abandoned, and P has been rebranded as simply ‘Weightless’.

The Weightless SIG is a non-profit, interestingly enough. They have made Weightless and open standard, ideally to increase uptake and innovation. However, it isn’t very popular, and there is not a lot of hardware available. The one exception is the Nwave smart parking company, they use a proprietary version of the old Weightless N standard which is very widespread.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Announces QuarkChain as Newest Investor]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC welcomed QuarkChain – the technology that aims to create a highly scalable and secure blockchain - as an MXC supporter.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-quarkchain-investor</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-quarkchain-investor</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Announces QuarkChain as Newest Investor
MXC Foundation, the break-through cryptocurrency promoting LPWAN technology powered by the MXProtocol, has today welcomed QuarkChain – the technology that aims to create a highly scalable and secure blockchain that can handle up to one million transactions per second using a two-layered blockchain system – as an investor to the organization.

“MXC’s mission is to make the world a better place by harnessing the potential of the IoT and blockchain and connecting the two so that artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed from it,” said Hu Xin, CEO of the MXC Foundation. “AI and Big Data are becoming the means for making better decisions. Our partnership with QuarkChain means we are one step closer to making everything smart, and therefore to helping individuals and enterprises take part in the shared economy where IoT data will be much more visible, transparent and ethically trackable.”

QuarkChain is a permissionless blockchain protocol aiming to set a global commercial standard for blockchain operations by providing a high capacity peer to peer transaction system, using a dual-layered blockchain architecture that implements sharding. QuarkChain believes this technology can successfully process more than 100,000 transactions per second.

“Decentralizing and tokenizing wireless service for devices will be one of blockchain technologies’ largest use cases,” said Qi Zhou, founder, and CEO of QuarkChain. “We’re looking forward to working with MXC to increase the usability of blockchain technology, addressing real-life problems and bringing the benefits of blockchain to more people in the world.”

MXC combines the LPWAN and the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol). This is then combined with the Machine eXchange Coin which supports the user with streamlined data transactions and data flow monetization. Individual users and enterprises can construct a decentralized and secure LPWAN simply by connecting a device to the online network. This enables any device connected to IoT to connect. IoT devices are then monetized through an LPWAN gateway where they can access all published data traded within the marketplace.

This is the Internet of Things (IoT)!]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/https://blog.mxc.org/what-is-iot/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/https://blog.mxc.org/what-is-iot/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## What is IoT?
I first joined the internet community in 2003 when I bought my first house. It was a dial-up connection back then. The technology was painfully slow, but I loved it. We were much more accepting before the days of broadband and raised expectations.

Fast-forward fifteen years and I can program my central heating from a remote location with my smartphone. This is the Internet of Things (IoT)!

The emergence of the internet converted the world into a global community with a whistle and a whir. Broadband silenced the noise, speeded up connections, and allowed us to share even more data to almost all corners of the globe.

But if you think we live in an interconnected world in 2018, you ain’t seen nothing yet! IoT will take us to the next level. What is IoT?

IoT ecosystems bring together web-enabled smart devices, wireless technologies, embedded processors, sensors, communication hardware, microelectromechanical systems, and microservices, that converge into one ultra-powerful machine-generated database.

In simple terms, any data that can be transferred from an internet-enabled device or consumer application can be collected, stored and shared.
With copious amounts of raw data at hand, decision-makers should be able to find better solutions, and companies will be able to develop sharing economies that enable individuals to profit from public data.

This is exactly what MXC Foundation aspires to bring to the IoT world.

Although IoT projections mostly remain aspirations, initiatives to best utilise connected devices are underway across multiple industries. The potential to improve our quality of life is within touching distance. And for most people, it’s transferable from a smartphone or desktop computer.

The data we can collect and share will (theoretically) make socio-economic operations more efficient, deliver customer demands, enhance customer services, improve city infrastructures, reduce living costs, and improve decision making.

## How is Data Transferred in an IoT Ecosystem?
What is IoT? An IoT ecosystem consists of everyday devices such as smartphones, TVs, computers and digital machines. Even animals and humans can be a “thing” in an IoT ecosystem.
Anybody that wears a pacemaker, for example, can transfer data about their health to their local hospital. This information is collected and monitored from a remote location. If your heart is approaching a critical condition, expect a call from your doctor.

[Livestock is given biochip responders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214180416301350) which inform consumers where the food you buy has come from and enables response units to trace and stem virus outbreaks quickly.

IoT devices share data through a series of sensors that are connected to gateways and sent to a central database. An example of how IoT may work in the home is the wireless-enabled [smart-fridge](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/is-your-refrigerator-running/) that lets you know when you’re out of milk.
Small things. But when this type of minute detail is made available to companies and local councils, there are larger private and public benefits.

Other noticeable benefits of IoT will be traffic analysis, energy networks, real estate locations, information around water pressure, crop farming, public transport and many other platforms of the industry can collect valuable data to help make decisions that will resolve 21st Century problems.

## Upgrading 20th Century infrastructure
Before we can tackle 21st Century issues, there is a pressing need to replace 20th Century infrastructures with 21st century technology that can cope with the demands huge transfers of data will require.

We currently have three types of network that can transfer data to a central application; MQTT, HTTP and CoAP. Herein lies two problems. A central database is not compatible with all three standard protocols, nor can the servers cope with data transfers from millions of sources.

You will know this from experience. If you have worked in an office with a dedicated server or used a broadband connection at peak times, you will probably have experienced system crashes and slow download speeds.
Technologies in the current infrastructure were designed for low bandwidth conditions. They cannot even cope with the average amount of traffic. So imagine how they would perform if millions of devices are connected.
The reality is they wouldn’t be able to perform at all.

## IoT’s Problems
IoT ecosystems cannot transfer huge amounts of data either, but they are being [designed to manage scalability in a secure environment](https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/designing-secure-and-scalable-internet-things-ecosystem-using-multiagent-systems). The more devices that are connected to the network, the abler they are to cope with the high-scale consumption demands.

In an IoT world, data is predominantly time-sensitive. If the information is not transferred in real-time for each device, the right time-stamp for sorting and alignment will not be verified instantly.

Historical data can be transferred, and whilst this will be sufficient in some scenarios, time delays will cause errors and awkward moments in the real world.
Imagine holding up the supermarket queue because your bank network is too congested to run through your security checks. You could be standing red-faced for several minutes. That’s awkward.

Fortunately, there is a solution: Low Power Wide Area Network.

## LPWAN will power IoT
Before IoT will work effectively, the ecosystem has to have a network that can handle huge quantities of data over a wide area without incurring jaw-dropping costs.
The current infrastructure used by telecommunication companies today is insufficient. Antennas and satellites are very expensive to build, maintain and operate.

LPWAN is the fuel that will power interconnectivity. These networks use less power so is not a burden on batteries. One charge can last an LPWAN sensor for up to ten years.

Another premium advantage of LPWAN is that they are more environmentally and economically friendly than telecom towers.
The power usage on the average 4G network uses between 2-6kW per tower. Some LPWAN gateways don’t use anywhere near that amount; 12.95 W at most.

LPWAN is already being used in key industry sectors such as healthcare, transportation, utility, and energy. [BI Intelligence estimates](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-low-power-wide-area-networks-report-market-potential-key-players-and-the-emerging-standards-for-low-power-long-range-networks-set-to-open-doors-for-iot-adoption-2016-8?r=DE&amp;IR=T) the total number of IoT devices connected by LPWANs will surpass 700 million by 2021.

There is little doubt that LPWAN can resolve the 21st Century problems we are facing. But how many telecommunications companies will adopt a low-cost solution?
Their answer is to introduce Narrowband (NB-IOT) technology, but end-users still rely on these companies to provide a service and maintenance. So why would you want to use a service that is reliant on a company when you can use an unlicensed LoRAWAN that is open to everyone.

It’s time the general public started looking towards tech start-ups that will provide low-cost solutions.

That is exactly what MXC Foundation is hoping to achieve. To provide a public service that is available to everyone at low cost and not dominated by the telecommunications monopoly.

MXC is working on the MXProtocol with a view to developing an LPWAN ecosystem that reduces the cost of utilities and other services. Within this ecosystem, everyday users have the opportunity to earn revenue by sharing public data via shared economy initiatives.

For example, do you have a thermostat or barometer measuring the weather and temperature? Then why not sell this data to weather stations via an app?
The data-chain will, of course, be pulled together by the blockchain, a decentralised and secure public ledger that can store massive amounts of data that cannot be corrupted or hacked.

## MXProtocol and IoT
![The-token-this-world-actually-needs-2-1](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/The-token-this-world-actually-needs-2-1_105aa322a2.png)

With the MXProtocol, the shared economy will be measured by an LPWAN gateway that functions as a node to collects data from individual sensors and sends it to servers.

LPWAN gateways are publicly owned and moderated by users in the same way as permissionless blockchains. There is no single entity that owns the network. Instead, individuals create a network and provide data as a service – for which they are financially compensated.

The potential for IoT to make your life easier and reduce the cost of living is not far from becoming a part of everyday life. You can’t expect to make a living from transferring data, but you will at least have a little more spare change in your digital wallet to play with.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MXC Guy News Update: Airbus and Silicon Valley]]></title><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-airbus-silicon-valley</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/mxc-airbus-silicon-valley</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## MXC Guy News Update: Airbus and Silicon Valley

MXC Foundation, the break-through cryptocurrency promoting LPWAN technology, announced today that Certik, a formal verification framework to prove smart contracts are bug-free and hacker-resistant, certified the MXC smart contract. This smart contract manages the vesting of MXC belonging to investors.“Third-party certifications are key to developing strong, bug-free and hacker resistant solutions,” said Vlad Karl, CTO of the MXC Foundation. “Passing a Certik certification demonstrates that the certified code designed to manage investments is bug-free and secure.”

The MXC smart contract supports the MXC token on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract’s primary function is to manage the vesting of the Machine eXchange Coin by enforcing a time lock mechanism. With this smart contract in place, MXC investors will legally own their MXC, however, the tokens will remain locked for the agreed upon time.

“It is the support of our investors that makes it possible to build the tools needed for a publicly owned wireless network for smart cities,” said Xin Hu, CEO of the MXC Foundation. “Now that we are certain their investments are safe, our development team can focus entirely on the development of the MXProtocol.”

MXC has a portfolio of powerful investors. These include Fenbushi Capital, BlockAsset Ventures, Longhash, the Vechain Foundation, Node Capital and Quarkchain. Each investor believes strongly in MXC and it’s a vision of building the future of IoT on a low power wide area network (LPWAN).

[Factory Berlin](https://factoryberlin.com/) a business club whose members include [Deutsche Bank](), [Audi](https://www.audi.de/de/brand/de.html) and [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/de/de.html), invited us to speak at their blockchain brunch on Thursday, August 23, 2018. Naturally, we broke out the slides and went there to share the MXC vision for the future of IoT.

During the presentation, Jeff Stahlnecker, growth manager and “the MXC Guy”, covered 4 reasons MXC is the best IoT cryptocurrency. He then described on how MXC can be used on a daily basis to create a publicly owned wireless network for devices. This tied nicely in with MXC enabled sharing economy, allowing individuals and companies to collect data as an asset, to be sold live from the data source, or as a dataset later in the future. Here’s his presentation:

Yes, I work at MXC, so naturally, I think it’s the best. So much so that I let them call me the MXC Guy! However, there are four reasons that took me from “MXC Employee” to “the MXC Guy.” I bet they will impress you too.

## 1. MXC will be **business ready** in 2019
MXC has exclusive access to hardware distributed in over 40 countries. This means we’re testing the MXProtocol on it, and adding the protocol to these devices will be easy. Just as easy as a simple update. What other IoT token can claim that what they designed is being used on hardware, for its purpose the year after they start? If you find one, let me know. (link: https://t.me/mxcfoundation text: Let’s chat about it in Telegram.)

## 2. MXC improves **wireless connectivity**
If you read our technical white paper, then you heard about the Anti-Colission Coordinator. This portion of the MXProtocol ensures that data isn’t sent over the same frequency at exactly the same time. You may have heard the “radio frequencies are like train tracks” analogy. One frequency is like one track. Two signals can’t travel over it at exactly the same time in the same space. Unfortunately, LPWAN technologies don’t coordinate when they send data, this data then collides and is lost. The Anti-Collision Coordinator fixes this problem.

## 3. MXC [interchain] **Data Market**
Data is collected consistently, all over the world. By default, some of this data belongs to you. You collected, it’s your data, period. Unfortunately, there aren’t many ways the “average Joe/Jill” can monetize this data. Well, not until now. MXC makes it possible for data collected over LPWAN to be easily sold through a digital market. This is great, as it also creates one place for buyers of data to look for what they want.

## 4. Building a **publicly owned** wireless network
This is just cool. Companies currently pay providers money to access a network. What if they paid you instead? We’re making that possible. All you need to do is set up an LPWAN Gateway and allow sensors to send their data over it. Now you’re probably thinking “but it costs so much money!” It really doesn’t. These devices run on very little power, and with IoT devices breeding faster than rabbits, you can expect sensor density in your city to increase rapidly. Check out my article on passive income with MXC if you’re curious about how this can work.

The conclusion? MXC is the best IoT token. As I said earlier – if you don’t agree with me, let me know.

We wish to both simplify and increase IoT data transactions utilizing the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN),” said Hu Xin, CEO of the MXC Foundation. “With the support of strong investors we are more confident than ever in our work to develop and drive the shared economy which will be at the heart of smart cities.”

Fenbushi Capital is the first Chinese venture capital firm that exclusively invests in blockchain-enabled companies. Their mission is to accelerate the inevitable future of blockchain economy by supporting as many organizations as possible. Fenbushi’s experience in the blockchain space will play an important role in bringing much more transparency, efficiency, and robustness into the global economy.

BlockAsset Ventures is an Asian blockchain technology fund that invests in promising blockchain startups. The fund leverages its years of experience in the digital asset space and strong industry relationships to invest in a portfolio of prominent digital assets.

Longhash is a platform for accelerating the development and understanding of blockchain technology. Its platform offers independent data analysis and media commentary, as well as a full range of support for blockchain start-ups including but not limited to professional services, modularized knowledge sharing, mentoring services, and investor outreach.

The VeChain Foundation is the world’s leading public blockchain platform offering Blockchain-as-a-Service to enterprises.

“The shared economy is the future of social and economic development and will underpin significant growth for organizations worldwide,” said Bo Shen, General Partner of Fenbushi Capital. “MXC’s unique offering will change the way IoT data is monetized, enabling distributed commerce both for companies and for individuals.”

David Lee Kuo Chen, Co-founder of BlockAsset added: “The idea of a bridge between traditional financial and payment systems, and the new world of FinTech and blockchain is both innovative and necessary. We share a primary interest with the MXC Foundation regarding decentralization as an area of research and investment. Open and inclusive blockchain has many socially beneficial properties besides being auditably secure and transparently accountable. It can restore faith and increase resilience in the financial system by enabling cross-border economic cooperation and integration.”

MXC combines the LPWAN and the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol). This is then combined with the Machine eXchange Coin which supports the user with streamlined data transactions and data flow monetization. Individual users and enterprises can construct a decentralized and secure LPWAN simply by connecting a device to the online network. This enables any device connected to IoT to connect. IoT devices are then monetized through an LPWAN gateway where they can access all published data traded within the marketplace.

“In order to improve efficiency as a society, we believe it is necessary to shift from a centralized economic model to a flatter, decentralized economic model where resource allocation is flexible, and individuals are empowered to make decisions based on transparent data and matching demand and supply in real time,” said Longhash CEO Chris Dai. “Our investment in MXC is a step forward in our mission to incubate and contribute to blockchain projects that truly enable individuals to build transparent and vibrant communities. “

“At its heart, MXC is a data trade network that leverages the sharing economy to form very wide, efficient networks where sensitive data is not shared randomly, an issue so many other solutions do not address,” said Sunny Lu, CEO of the VeChain Foundation. “Great transparency and immutability the combination of IoT and blockchain technology can provide, we believe, is the solution to tackle problems such as data manipulation.”

“MXC’s core MXProtocol is extremely impressive for enabling lightning fast transactions, and that is exactly the kind of breakthrough technology we want to see gain wider adoption,” said Du Jun, CEO of Node Capital. “Our investment in MXC reflects our desire to build a smarter data-driven Blockchain community that truly empowers every individual.”</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Knowing Your Customer (KYC) in Blockchain]]></title><description><![CDATA[KYC is any process that a business uses to verify the identity of its customers or clients.

Almost from the very beginning, the anonymity of cryptocurency exchange and its non-reliance on regulated banking systems have made them attractive to certain criminals. As it became obvious that blockchain-based currencies were not going to simply disappear, governments around the world began the slow process of developing systems to regulate Crypto Exchanges and the other platforms people use to exchange Bitcoins, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies for goods, services and other types of currency.

![1_7A1Reae0FgaxcpPv3GIUfQ](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/1_7A1Reae0FgaxcpPv3GIUfQ_7d110e06b5.png)

As a result, to sign up to a cryptocurency exchange run almost anywhere in the world, you need to complete some kind of KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure to fully participate. If any person or organisation expects to use crypto exchanges at any viable economic level, or even to make large one-off exchanges, they should expect to provide a fair amount of personal information.

However, many exchanges do allow small, casual transactions to be conducted anonymously (or nearly so) to this day. This makes good business sense for the exchange, and represents little risk to any interested regulating entities. It allows potential customers to engage with the service in a limited fashion without a big investment of time, effort, or exposure. The exchanges need this to attract new customers. The regulating agencies need it because, simply put, if they make it impossible to do business legally someone will just do it illegally, and completely without oversight.

**So what is Know Your Customer?**

KYC is any process that a business uses to verify the identity of its customers or clients. It is very similar to (and often confused with) AML — Anti Money Laundering regulations — which achieve many of the same purposes with traditional currencies and financial systems.

KYC is not ‘One Size Fits All’, though. There are three distinct grades, each of which is useful in different contexts and for different purposes.

**1) No KYC At All**

This is becoming rare, of course, but many regions still allow this method of buying cryptocurrencies. No KYC means that the crypto exchange or whatever platform is handling the actual transaction has no way of knowing who you are. You don’t need to identify yourself when creating an account, logging in or making the exchange. If you pay with traditional currency, you use something like cash, a gift card, or Western Union.

Overall, it is riskier and typically more expensive for that reason. Still, there are plenty of people willing to spend a little extra for total privacy.

**2) ‘Basic’ KYC**

This type keeps some data on the people who use it. Exchange participants can typically be identified by the phone numbers or ISPs they use, as well as their payment channels. If you use PayPal, MasterCard or Visa to process payments, your exchange uses at least this level of KYC.

Again, the KYC procedures may not be required until a particular user exchanges, say, $10,000 worth of cryptocurency in a single month. Users would be blocked from doing more business until they had completed the KYC procedures and been identified.

**3) Full KYC**

This is usually added in on top of ‘basic’ KYC. It requires users to provide documents of some kind which prove their identity. This might require an image of a recognised ID, such as a driver’s license or a passport. Many systems also demand bank statements, utility bills, and more to prove that you live where you say you do and have actual access to the address. More advanced systems demand a snapshot of the customer holding the ID in question near their face, proving that they have the original card.

![1_WHrt5Yo3J8vbrOA3amD7Zw](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/1_WHrt5Yo3J8vbrOA3amD7Zw_27742eb479.png)

**Is privacy such a concern?**

It can be. Each transaction is preserved in the blockchain forever. These can be traced back, so the amount of private information you give over to a crypto exchange could be worrying. Even more so when people are becoming aware of just how much this personal information can be used (or abused, depending on who you ask) beyond the intent of the original transaction.

This private information can be used for a variety of ways, not all of which are completely innocent:

· Analysis of customer identity

· Assessing the risk a customer poses in terms of crimes or regulated behaviours such as money laundering, identity theft, or the financing of terrorism

· Compiling and analysing a profile of a customer’s transactional behaviour

· Collecting a portfolio of one customer’s spending habits across several platforms in order to predict or manipulate their behaviour

· Identifying the spending habits of publicly known people by matching their name

**Who actually does the KYC?**

Now, that is where it gets interesting. There is suddenly a huge market for outsourced KYC, as cryptocurrencies, exchanges, platforms and other market participants all engage in a bit of CYA to make sure they are not in violation of any KYC laws, regulations or guidelines in any of the jurisdictions in which they do or would like to operate.

![1_8YNx3PhPXCL89uosrK92vg](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/1_8YNx3PhPXCL89uosrK92vg_c57499bff8.png)

**How will MXC handle KYC?**

They haven’t publicly launched their KYC process yet, but MXC will be using a name you might well recognise in the world of 3rd party KYC. 4Stop is a full service 3rd party KYC and fraud prevention company based in Cologne. They are fully certified to handle this kind of KYC work, and they have a reputation for reliable, real-time results. More importantly, though, they have a reputation for excellent and detail-oriented security.

4Stop uses a hybrid detection model where automated systems are used to pass the vast majority of users and transactions as 100% above board, and flags any ‘suspicious’ transactions or data in real time, sending it to be checked by a well-trained human operative. Of course, this takes more than the few microseconds that the automated systems do, but that is a small price to pay for certainty.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Full house at MXC Launch Party in Berlin]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our first event was a massive success!

After a short introduction from Factory Berlin – CEO Xin Hu took the stage to introduce MXProtocol and provide a few use cases. [Graham Buck, editorial contributor to FinTech Futures reported](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2018/07/city-spotlight-tech-bin-ein-berliner/):

“Hu summarised MXC’s mission as making the world a better place by harnessing the potential of the IoT and blockchain and connecting the two so that artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed from it. While AI has been a buzz phrase, it is becoming the means for making better decisions and Big Data is the key to achieving this.”

I’ve recently written about [smart contracts](https://medium.com/mxc/smart-contracts-smart-assets-and-how-the-blockchain-might-just-do-away-with-lawyers-20deb592ada8), but that piece led me to think about the actual mechanisms behind smart contracts, and the way that cryptocurrencies such as MXC, Mobius, Streamr and IOTA could contribute to making these self-executing agreements more trustworthy, more efficient and more profitable all around.

**Oracles, more than ‘the man in the funny hat from Tron’**

First, I should explain what oracles are and how they make self-executing agreements such as smart contracts possible. Smart contracts exist in the abstract, they are just data. Unless you build in the ability for it to check on developments in the outside world, it won’t do anything, ever. If you want it to pay into an account every Thursday at 5pm, then you need to include all the details of which clock it is going to monitor, and exactly what both parties mean by ‘5 pm’. Once you’ve set that up, that clock is an oracle for that smart contract.

An oracle is a 3rd party service- something that is not typically a participant in the blockchain consensus mechanism. It could be owned and operated by one of the participants in the contract, of course, but it is better of it is handled by a truly neutral, disinterested party. This is important because the oracle is the eyes and ears of the smart contract.

A smart contract is a series of if/then statements at heart. ‘IF goods shipment X arrives at Destination Y by time Z THEN move 10 ETH from wallet A to wallet B.” The contract is the brain, the judgement and the intention. But it is blind and deaf. It consults an oracle about whether any condition has been met. In this case, the oracle might be linked to the receiving site’s warehouse management system. In another instance, it could check with an oracle to find out whether a permission has been granted, a service has been performed, or whether a certain team won the World Cup or not.

**And what do blockchain technologies add to this?**

We’ll break that down across 4 separate currencies below, but in essence each provides a secure way for data to be copied and transmitted without alteration. Smart contracts, bitcoin scripts and similar devices cannot go out and get their own data, so some secure, reliable source of oracle data is necessary of smart contracts are going to become popular, or efficient.

**MXC**

[MXC](https://www.mxc.org/)’s MXProtocol was designed specifically to facilitate the movement of data between different blockchains. The use of oracles was ‘baked into the code’ with the intention of building up a stable of trusted, reliable external oracles which could become a common library for building new smart contracts and other bits of self-executing code.

More importantly, MXProtocol was envisioned as a way for LPWAN datastreams to become part of smart contracts directly. This MXP becomes a source of oracles for other blockchains, like Etherium. It can also be used by Web APIs and other non-blockchain applications, just without all of the certainty and transparency that the blockchain provides.

This is one of the real strengths of the MXProtocol Inter-Chain Data Market. The source, processing and flow of the information (essentially the entire oracle) is itself verifiable with a separate blockchain. It is inherently trustworthy and transparent, by design.

**Mobius**

[Mobius](https://mobius.network/) relies on their API to connect a wide range of non-blockchain applications to their blockchain. They support this with developer tools, their own app store and their Smart Market where large data feeds and micro services alike can be accessed.

This is all aimed at making the setting up of oracles easy. But how do they address the security issues of the API connection? The Mobius Network’s Smart Market encrypts all of the information sent by their oracles at the source. This is both a method for ensuring the integrity of the information and a payment device — what you actually bid for is the decryption keys for the oracle’s data feeds. Not perfect, but elegant.

**Streamr**

[Streamr](https://streamr.network/) uses a ‘hybrid data retrieval approach’. In the case of smart contracts, the Streamr Network incentivises their ‘broker nodes’ to act as oracles.

This has most of the advantages of MXP’s all-blockchain approach. The data supplied is signed at its source, and it can be pushed directly to smart contracts. However, it doesn’t overcome the uncertainty of the API connection and doesn’t offer the transparency of a truly 3rd party oracle — at least not for smart contracts that exist inside the Streamr Network.

**IOTA**

[IOTA](https://www.iota.org/)’s Qubiq project is harder to assess, as it hasn’t really landed yet. It is essentially a new layer to the Tangle protocol which is custom designed to handle oracles and the data needs of smart contracts in, as they say, ‘the most scalable and minimal fee manner possible’.

It is not a new token, but rather a way to access the IOTA network. This should not only allow for new, more complex IoT applications, it intends to make new kinds of smart contracts possible, incorporating real-time micro-payments. We are told that there will be a system to reward participation, so perhaps oracles will be paid in a similar manner to MXP’s solution. We shall have to wait and see.

So these are just 4 ways of providing the kind of high quality, secure and inexpensive oracle data smart contracts and other bits of self-executing code need to behave more intelligently, efficiently and transparently. This is one of those situations which is in a great deal of flux, and the ‘industry standard’ in 10 years could be based on any one of them — or on something else altogether. I’ll be keeping my eye on this to see how it all shakes out.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Who's Ready for IoT?

Leaders in LPWAN.
The Internet of Things (IoT) can only be as good as the connectivity that will host it. For better or worse, an average reader of this post likely deals with different devices that demand a variety of wireless networks on a daily basis. Personally, I instantly recall the countless times I’ve leeched off cafe WiFi, my Bluetooth headset that keeps booting off my car’s connection, and my cellular data bills that somehow keeps getting larger…

Despite the plethora of wireless networks that we engage with every day, they aren’t quite the right fit for IoT applications. Smart devices used for industrial- and enterprise-level IoT require:

- long range (aka wide area)
- low data rate
- low energy consumption
- cost-effectiveness

The various popular networks that we use to connect our consumer devices are limiting in one or more of these aspects. WiFi, for example, is not suitable for hosting, say, thousands of smart electric utility meters monitoring the usage of households, businesses, and other electricity-using entities across a metropolitan area. Just think what the price tag would be if that same network was powered by cellular.

Let’s consider a less dense network: a farm where there are multiple types of sensors distributed across many acres of land. WiFi or Bluetooth would certainly not be able to handle that range. And, again, just think what the price tag would be if that same network was powered by cellular.

**According to the [2015 Machina Research findings](https://machinaresearch.com/news/global-m2m-market-to-grow-to-27-billion-devices-generating-usd16-trillion-revenue-in-2024/), machine-to-machine (M2M) connections will grow from 5 billion in 2014 to 27 billion by 2024**. Machine-generated is on the rise. The need to be able to accommodate this scale efficiently — both money-wise and power-wise — is here and now. That is why MXC has developed MXProtocol specifically for LPWAN technologies.

## WTF is LPWAN?
A low-power, wide area network (LPWAN) is exactly what its title makes it out to be. LPWANs operate at a **lower cost** with **greater power efficiency** while supporting **more devices** over a **wider range** compared to traditional mobile networks. These features are just the right balance to be able to aggressively meet your IoT reality. Check out an earlier MXC Foundation post that provides a handy chart on the specific advantages of LPWAN compared to other network systems.

LPWAN technologies can take many shapes and forms and can use licensed or unlicensed frequencies, as well as include proprietary or open standard options. The leading LPWAN standards include:

- MXProtocol
- LoRaWAN
- Sigfox protocol
- Ingenu Inc.’s RPMA (formerly On-Ramp Wireless)
- Weightless LPWAN

## MXProtocol + M2M + LPWAN = Premium IoT
The beauty of MXProtocol is that it is not only compatible, but bridges the data gap between the LPWAN standards mentioned above. In fact, MXC Foundation is partnered with various LPWAN companies in an effort to make the LPWAN infrastructure the world’s largest device data shared economy.

As more LPWANs are increasingly set up, MXProtocol provides the ability to reconcile these competing networks residing in the same region and operating in unlicensed (open for everyone) frequency. Using MXProtocol, micro-payments within the LPWAN infrastructure will be traded from third party sensors/end devices, ensuring data is conveniently, correctly and concisely transmitted in a secure manner, while still being maintained by system administrators. This decentralized and consensus-based mechanism improves the usability of LPWAN, lowering the bar for increased participation by individual network users, corporations and enterprises.

## Taking LPWAN to the IoT Level
Topologies and network architectures similar to LPWAN were kicking around in the 1980 and early 1990s. However, it is only within this decade that the emergence of LPWAN as we are referring to it has started to create a buzz. It’s popularity grows in tandem with the universal vision of connecting “things” to help make things operate at maximum efficiency and to unlock new standards for safety, improved systems and quality of life.

Countries around the world are joining the race to create the infrastructure necessary to lead in the IoT space, but many of them are currently gearing themselves towards investments in NB-IoT, which is a **cellular** LPWAN standard. You also may be aware of the race towards 5G which is expected to be officially standardized next year by 3GPP. It’s the bet that large network operators are taking.

But, in order to be truly **unshackled by proximity (and cost of using) cell towers, to gain greater data protection** and to **prevent public congestion** altogether, using MXProtocol on LPWAN is the truly **people-owned network** that empowers its users to apply it as they need.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interested in MXC?

**Berlin, 28 June, 2018** – MXC Foundation, the break-through cryptocurrency promoting LPWAN technology powered by the MXProtocol, has today announced its newest investor, the VeChain Foundation, the Singapore based public blockchain platform that focuses on providing enterprise-level blockchain solutions for numerous industries.

“At MXC we aim to create a decentralized, global IoT economy, where the data market is something individuals and small companies can participate in, and profit from,” said Hu Xin, CEO of the MXC Foundation. “With the support from the VeChain Foundation, we are one step closer to achieving a shared economy where IoT data will be much more visible, transparent and ethically trackable.”

The VeChain Foundation is the world’s leading public blockchain platform offering Blockchain-as-a-Service to enterprises. By leveraging blockchain technology, the VeChain Foundation continuously aims at optimizing and adding value to the scope and development of its VeChainThor platform. In order to create a platform with holistic capabilities, the VeChain Foundation’s approach is to include the world’s best service providers, reputable enterprises and global experts into their platform’s ecosystem to ensure the integration of as many business activities as possible.

“At its heart, MXC is a data trade network that leverages the sharing economy to form very wide, efficient networks where sensitive data is not shared randomly, an issue so many other solutions do not address,” said Sunny Lu, CEO of the VeChain Foundation. “Great transparency and immutability, along with the combination of IoT and blockchain technology can provide, we believe, is the solution to tackle problems such as data manipulation.”

MXC combines the LPWAN and the Machine eXchange Protocol (MXProtocol). This is then combined with the Machine eXchange Coin which supports the user with streamlined data transactions and data flow monetization. Individual users and enterprises can construct a decentralized and secure LPWAN simply by connecting a device to the online network. This enables any device connected to IoT to connect. IoT devices are then monetized through an LPWAN gateway where they can access all published data traded within the marketplace.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Monitizing LPWAN Helps the Sharing Economy]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC’s MXProtocol seeks to reinvigorate the shared LPWAN LoRaWAN gateway model by adding a very interesting feature — Smart Bidding.]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/monetization-lpwan-network-sharing-economy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/monetization-lpwan-network-sharing-economy</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Monitizing LPWAN Helps the Sharing Economy
First, let’s define a few terms. I’ll assume you know what low power wide access networks (LPWANs) are, and how the IoT uses them. But the interaction of LPWANs and the sharing economy bears examination.

## The LPWAN Sharing Economy Model
Most LPWANs use unlicensed spectrums, which anyone (or more to the point, anything) can access freely. Organizations can set up gateways or base stations anywhere, which can, in theory, reach out to a shifting network of IoT devices across many square miles.

However, if there are too many gateways, they will begin stepping on each others’ signals and make the entire system inefficient.

One solution is to use a shared gateway model, rather than a proliferation of private gateways. The gateways are publicly accessible, and the costs are borne by the operators of the gateways. The costs consist of bandwidth and power used, and of course, buying and maintaining the hardware.

## Who actually pays for this?
Gateway operation costs can be recouped in several ways. In time, the organizations who field IoT devices will contract with gateway operators to send the data through their devices. The cost per data packet will be much lower than with the current system, where data users maintain their own private gateways.

But, if your devices are using a shared gateway, who do you pay? The gateway operators are forced to work that out between themselves, becoming a kind of de facto public data grid. Contracting with any gateway operator would, in theory, give you access to the entire shared gateway network.

## But what about shared LPWAN neutrality?
Aye, there’s the rub. What happens when the inefficiency is not caused by too many gateways, but too few? What happens when you start losing vital packets because the gateways are spread too thinly, or because there are just too many IoT devices accessing the system at once?

The short answer is that wait times grow from a few milliseconds to several minutes, and the networks become increasingly difficult to use.

## How MXC allows operators to monetize these shared networks
MXC’s MXProtocol seeks to reinvigorate the shared LPWAN gateway model by adding a very interesting feature — Smart Bidding. IoT data users can place a maximum bid on the priority of their data. All the data will still be allocated time — it all gets where it is going eventually — but systems which require data to be delivered regularly, quickly, or with the maximum of reliability can bid higher.

This system allows anyone to use an already established network. They always have the option to purchase and maintain their own network systems. It’s just that if you have mobile systems you would have to cover the entire city with your own gateways. That can be impractically expensive and complex. In MXProtocol’s shared gateway system when a device being tracked goes out of range, it can communicate through someone else’s gateway. This does mean paying the gateway owner for access, but that is for access that the original operator would never have otherwise. Instead, it uses device resources that the owner of the next gateway would normally not need, and would be wasted.

Like Airbnb, the gateway operator can open up its unused bandwidth for bidding, and recoup some small amount of money for it. If the guest user bids high enough, the gateway owner might even delay their own low-priority use in favor of the payment.

Some users might be willing to pay as many as a few fractions of a penny per packet. They would be virtually guaranteed of getting the first crack at the system resources no matter what gateway they were using. Other users might not wish to bid very much at all. This would cause their data to be delayed slightly at times or places of peak traffic, but this will be perfectly acceptable to many users.

## That doesn’t sound very ‘sharing’, but it really is.
The sharing economy is about making more efficient use of resources. It means making access less expensive, by making smarter choices about how resources are used.

## What happens in MXProtocol when there is plenty of network capacity?
That’s easy. Everyone gets the same ‘premium’ service, only paying to access another network if theirs is out of range of the device in question.

## What happens when a network gateway does get congested?
That’s simple too. The customers who are using the capacity for low priority tasks and really don’t care about a little extra latency continue on like nothing is happening. They might have to resend a few packets, at the very worst.

But the customers whose devices are operating high priority devices or doing something else — anything else — that they feel is critical, have registered their willingness to pay a little extra to use another network’s capacity. They don’t have to make the decision when the congestion occurs — the system knows their preferences, does all the work invisibly, transferring any payments due directly between the users involved them at the end.

## Smart bidding systems like MXProtocol are not making LPWAN expensive.
They enable users to accommodate more sensors to existing LPWANs without adding extra capacity, by making the prioritization of data automatic, transparent, and customer-led.

The biggest objection anyone can have is that it costs money, and it costs so very little money that it barely matters.

Win-Win.

As smart technologies become ubiquitous in every part of our lives – from personal devices to public infrastructures – the **ever-expanding digital infrastructure poses ever-growing vulnerabilities**.

The reality is that IoT requires umpteen devices and sensors to connect and share potentially crucial or personal information. IoT thought leader, John Moor of IoT Security Foundation, proactively warns the IoT community, in his (link: https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/why-iot-security-needs-more-bs/ text: recent post), that “digital hygiene is no longer optional.” In fact, the first of three core IoT values he outlines is that **security** cannot be an afterthought – it needs to be integrated **by design**. With so much at stake, security should be at the top of the mind, right?

Here at MXC, the answer is, Duh! Security is intrinsic to what we do. Always. Seriously. Security is baked into the design of how MXProtocol operates.

MXProtocol leverages the asymptotic security of blockchain technology (keep reading if you don’t know what this is!), and combines it with a data market (this too!) facilitated by Machine eXchange Coin (MXC).

## First, a little **background on MXProtocol**
The future of IoT will inevitably depend on LPWAN, which requires the lowest power currently possible for a low cost and wide access connectivity. While the technology has been around for a decade, it didn’t quite take off…until now. MXC solutions are making way for a new generation LPWAN by providing the tools to empower anyone to build an efficient and secure machine-connected network. The MXProtocol provides the first consumer-friendly eco-system of IoT and blockchain “plugins” through which individuals and organizations alike can participate in the construction of a decentralized, ubiquitous and secure LPWAN.

![screen-shot-2018-06-10-at-8.48.05-pm](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/screen-shot-2018-06-10-at-8.48.05-pm_e3c3a3b342.png)

If you take a look at the MXProtocol stack, you can see that a decentralized and autonomous LPWAN is built for a permissionless blockchain. MXProtocol can work on any permissionless blockchain, such as **IOTA**, **Stellar**, **Skywire** and **NEO**. The blockchain technology allows this massive network of data to be securely traded in the MXProtocol inter-chain data marketplace. Only trustworthy “things” would autonomously pay each other with MXC tokens and get accredited by sharing the data with different users/marketplaces.

## Blockchain: Asymptotic Security
MXProtocol is built for permissionless blockchain with these four must-haves:

- Decentralized control
- Low latency
- Flexible trust
- Asymptotic security
- Let’s focus on the fourth.

Asymptotic security permits *affordable* exchange between honest parties, but makes exchange *prohibitively costly* to “*adversaries*”. Think spammers, hackers and other bad apples. Basically, in order to utilize MXProtocol, it is required that there be an anti-spam role as a preventive measure against nefarious users flooding the network.

## MXC Economy: **Managing data as an asset**
Now, let’s talk about how your data are secured through MXProtocol.

By being distributed among data owners, data receivers and data network hosts, MXC is the first token designed to bridge current commodity-based trading of cryptocurrency tokens and data collected using sensors. Individuals and enterprises will be able to purchase data as it is being collected from a sensor.

*Data can be easily passed, copied and edited* by a number of parties without their knowing whether the data has been corrupted or shared amongst potential competitors or unauthorized parties. Its source and those who rely on its authority have meanwhile no mechanisms to ensure the data is authentic.

With MXC, data in the MXC economy can be allocated to one dedicated source; an LPWAN sensor. Thus, MXC makes it possible to track intangible data so that *only the appropriate buyer/receiver gets access to the data*, as well as ensuring that the information is coming from a qualified and reliable source.

Gone are the days of crossing your fingers, hoping that a paper certificate hasn’t been sold, copied or exposed to potential multiple parties on its way to the actual buyer.

## Safe and sound from the moment you plug-and-play
As the future of IoT puts greater pressure on all of us to optimize connectivity, speed and use of resources as ambitiously as possible, we want to make sure that security practices don’t end up trying to catch up to the needs of the growing data exchanges. End-to-end encryption is inextricable from MXProtocol so you can rest assured that **data authorship and financial transactions remain secure in the MXC economy**.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Op - Why investing in MXC is logical]]></title><description><![CDATA[Would it surprise you to learn that a technology developed ten years ago can do all of this MUCH better?

Remember those old Mac and Windows commercials? They depicted Mac as an easy going guy who could do what you needed without extra steps or baggage. Then came Windows. Windows was the corporate guy with red tape for just about everything.

IoT technologies today commonly use heavy, slow and inefficient standards. This might be Bluetooth – sucking all of your battery power. It may be WIFI – dropping in and out, and sucking all of your battery power. Or perhaps it’s GSM, 3G, LTE, 5G. Dropping in and out, sucking your battery power AND emptying your bank account. These are the technologies companies use to manage on-demand bikes like Mobike, or car sharing companies like Drive Now. Imagine the same tech being used for street lamps, synchronizing public clocks, monitoring trash levels in public bins, smart sheep … Yikes…

Would it surprise you to learn that a technology developed ten years ago can do all of this MUCH better? This is LPWAN. It works, ANYONE can use it, build stuff with it, and sell it. Unfortunately, it didn’t get the attention it deserved.

![comparison](https://cms.mxc.org/uploads/comparison_a78aedfa40.png)

Why didn’t it gain enough attention? People weren’t motivated to adopt it. After all — why change a system that still works and has a fully built infrastructure?

## MXC creates a **decentralized, global IoT economy**
Today at least (link: https://technology.ihs.com/596542/number-of-connected-iot-devices-will-surge-to-125-billion-by-2030-ihs-markit-says text: 27 billion IoT devices exist in the world). (link: https://technology.ihs.com/596542/number-of-connected-iot-devices-will-surge-to-125-billion-by-2030-ihs-markit-says text: By 2030 there will be 125 billion.) This is a massive increase and nearly 16 times the world’s current population.

All of these devices continually collect data. (link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/08/05/iot-mid-year-update-from-idc-and-other-research-firms/ text: IDC predicts that by 2025 IoT devices will collect 180 zettabytes of data). This data will then be sold, traded or used for interesting research.

MXC removes the “middle-man”, enabling each individual to share in the profits by providing connectivity. Investing in MXC helps to build an LPWAN network that anyone can provide and participate in.

## Data is already traded and sold. MXC enables **individuals to participate** in this market
Companies collect information like weather patterns, air quality — public information that is then used and sold to other companies. MXC opens this closed market to anybody who wants to participate in it. Data you collect will be stored and stamped in the blockchain as your data. You are the owner and the original source, nobody else is. Companies or research institutions searching for this data will then be able to find it, and pay you for access. Some may even pay for live access by setting up smart contracts to automatically pull your data into their system or product. Investing in MXC makes it possible for each person on the planet to collect, use, and resell data.

## Smart cities are on their way and should be built using the **most efficient technology**
We all pay taxes. Some of these taxes go into the research, development, and maintenance of smart cities. If these cities end up using cellular technology instead of LPWAN, the amount paid to mobile providers will be massive. By investing in MXC and LPWAN, the money spent to maintain these systems will not only be reduced, but it will also be redistributed back to the people.

## In the end…
I covered a few of the altruistic reasons to invest in MXC. The final kicker is one simple fact. *The value of MXC will continually increase*. MXC’s market cap represents the value of Device Data in total. That said – it’s easy to see why MXC is the future of IoT.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to earn passive income with MXC]]></title><description><![CDATA[MXC provides two excellent and truly passive ways to make some money.

Passive income is the holy grail of personal finance. Every finance class or conversation I had since high school included something about passive income. At one time I was so obsessed with it that I continually played the game “Cashflow” to prepare myself to be a king of passive income (hint: I’m not). Passive income is money that you earn, without traveling to work, or spending any large amount of time earning it. Essentially money you make with little to no effort. Here is Rich Dad’s definition:

*“Passive income: Generally derived from real estate, royalties, and distributions. It is the lowest-taxed income, with many tax benefits, and is the easiest income to build wealth with thanks to its combination of low taxes and potentially infinite returns. Rich dad said, “If you want to be rich, work for passive income.”*– (link: https://www.richdad.com/resources/rich-dad-financial-education-blog/october-2017/six-basic-rules-of-investing text: Rich Dad)

There are a variety of ways to earn passive income. Carrie Smith wrote an itemized list of some potential options. These include self-publishing a “how to” ebook on Amazon. Earn royalties from a fiction book. Writing a blog that attracts a lot of traffic, and monetizing it with advertising. Shannon Insler provided excellent advice on how to get started:

*“Focus on what you think you can sustainably manage; a smart passive income strategy is to simply choose carefully.”* – (link: https://studentloanhero.com/featured/passive-income-earn-extra-money/ text: Student Loan Hero)

Bitcoin once offered a great way to earn some extra cash by leaving your computer on overnight. Unfortunately, mining for Bitcoin isn’t as easy as it used to be (or as cheap). This is where MXC’s modern model of earning cryptocurrency comes in.

MXC provides two excellent and truly passive ways to make some money. Yes – you need to make an initial investment in some hardware. Once you have it set up, the data you collect or the services you provide may earn you some Machine Exchange Coin. Here are your options:

## **Method 1: become an LPWAN Provider to “Harvest” MXC**
Buy an LPWAN Gateway and allow local sensors to use your device for network access. This is MXC’s version of “mining” (or what we call “harvesting”) the coin – and trust me – it will cost you a whole lot less than a bunch of GPU’s in Antarctica. Don’t trust me? Here are the numbers:

## Some convenient and very technical assumptions:
You have one LPWAN gateway covering a diameter of 10 KM. Within this range is 1000 sensors with an average uplink interval of 5 minutes. There are also 100 high priority sensors that need an average downlink of once per hour. Add 100 sensors from another network sending an average of once every 5 minutes.

The numbers based on these assumptions:

- 2,000 times uplink contention/h
- 100 times downlink bidding/h
- 72,000 downlink/month
- 1,440,000 uplink / month

Average Earned:

- 1,000 downlinks = about 1 Euro
- 10K uplinks = about 1 Euro

Estimated passive income for this gateway in this scenario:

- 216 Euros

Now – how much will this technology cost you to buy and operate?

- MatchX MatchBox: 350 Euros
- Electricity 21kWh = less than 1 Euro
- Internet fees: 20 Euros

This is a total of 371 Euros for the first month and 21 Euros per month for the following months. Using these “convenient assumptions,” you will break even in two months. In this scenario, each following month may make a passive income (minus expenses) of about 195 Euros per month.

Yes for this calculation I used a series of convenient assumptions. Your location may have more competition. It might have fewer sensors bidding for access. Even so, as LPWAN spreads so will the number of sensors. Also, keep in mind that an area may become FULLY SATURATED with LPWAN Gateways creating a lot more competition.

## **Method 2: collect data to resell to interested people, companies, universities …**
You can also earn MXC by selling sensor data. This can even be automated using smart contracts. You can use your LPWAN Gateway (or another person’s) and some LPWAN sensors to collect data that can then be resold. The easiest data to collect is likely environmental data like weather and air quality. That said – there are quite a few types of data you can collect and resell. This is a long-term strategy and the passive income you make depends highly on the number of people purchasing the data you collect. Keep in mind – that this data is an asset. In ten years someone might want to purchase the data you’re collecting today.

## **How to get started earning passive income with MXC**
First – sign up to receive our soon to be released “how to get started” toolkit. This kit includes the tools you need to calculate how much MXC you might be able to earn with an LPWAN gateway. You will also receive some basic promotional items for LPWAN that you can either print or send to local businesses. Just use the form below and we will send you the kit once we finish building it.

Yes – this is a somewhat “active” way to get started. But once you have your empire built, just sit back, relax and watch as your wallet fills with the Machine Exchange Coin.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Revealing the future of Internet of Things: MXC]]></title><description><![CDATA[With blockchain came a lot of potential. A decentralized currency, an irrefutable ledger, and tons of companies hoping to profit from the trend of releasing the "next greatest coin since Bitcoin."]]></description><link>https://mxc-foundation.github.io/revealing-the-future-of-internet-of-things-mxc</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://mxc-foundation.github.io/revealing-the-future-of-internet-of-things-mxc</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>## Revealing the future of Internet of Things: MXC
With blockchain came a lot of potential. A decentralized currency, an irrefutable ledger, and tons of companies hoping to profit from the trend of releasing the “next greatest coin since Bitcoin.” Each new cryptocurrency promised easy international transactions and a high level of security. Why is the Machine Exchange Coin (MXC) different?

## **A Coin with a Purpose**
We launched the MXC Foundation to improve the IoT industry.
MXC is the future of IoT.

There is a relatively new technology that reduces the cost of building and maintaining a smart city (or most IoT related applications). It’s called LPWAN. Normally cool tech like this belongs to large companies like Telekom or Vodafone. Instead, this technology was released in the public domain, making it possible for anyone to use it, and profit from it.

LPWAN has the potential to replace the technology used to track vehicles or bikes in car sharing or bike sharing industries. Did you know that most on-demand bikes have SIM cards in them, like your cell phone? Imagine how much that costs! Then think about how often your phone’s battery dies. An LPWAN sensor can last up to ten years on a single battery charge. It’s a massive improvement.

**Problem**: LPWAN isn’t publicly available or even used in many cities.
**Idea: make it possible for you, the people of the world, to earn money by becoming an LPWAN provider.
**

Next came the problem of data. Have you heard about big data? Probably. This is lots of information about practically everything. What you may not know is that most of this have nothing to do with you. Nope – you are not the center of this universe. Big data includes information about air quality, weather, light, sheep… this list is quite big. With LPWAN, you have the ability to collect this data.

Do you have a thermostat outside telling you today’s temperature? Maybe you even have a barometer, and a little device telling you the wind speed. Well, why don’t you sell this information to your favorite weather app?

Problem number two: it takes time, connections and technical knowledge to set things like this up.

**Idea: make it possible for devices to automatically sell non-identifiable data.**

Our last problem was that the platform didn’t exist. If Joe collects data, how can Alan know that it’s accurate and not random numbers? How does Bill trust Judy’s LPWAN network? How does my European Union Euro device receive payments from a University in Australia? Which currency will it accept? Also – how do I pay .0000001 cent for a tiny bit of information?

**Solution: the Machine Exchange Coin and the MXProtocol.**

## What is **MXProtocol**?
Behind every great production is a team of stagehands working to ensure that everything runs smoothly. At MXC this is the MXProtocol (Machine Exchange Protocol). This protocol facilitates the exchange of data and payments between machines.

Imagine a skyscraper with two LPWAN gateways. One gateway is in an apartment on the first floor, and the other is mounted on top of the building. The owner of the gateway on top of the building will likely have better connectivity than the person on the first floor. Because of this, the gateway on top of the building will charge more for network access than the gateway on the first floor.

In a normal network, a device responds to requests in the order that they are received. With the MXProtocol, the LPWAN gateway is able to respond and allow access only to the sensors willing to pay the price programmed in the gateway. This makes it possible for sensors to “bid” for network access, with the highest bid receiving access first. We call this smart bidding.

Though we built a really fast coin for machine-to-machine payments, we know that some people will want to stick with THEIR blockchain solution. The MXProtocol makes this possible. If you want to purchase data using Ether – go for it. We’re not stopping you. This is our Inter-Chain Data Market.

## The result: **a unique coin with a purpose**
All of this makes MXC different from other cryptocurrencies. It is the best cryptocurrency for device data transactions – but we won’t force you to use it. Just keep in mind – MXC enables the development of smart cities. MXC allows individuals like you to earn money by providing LPWAN services. **MXC is the future of IoT**.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why shouldn't we profit from our own data?]]></title><description><![CDATA[People are becoming more and more concerned with how this data is being used.

In the wake of Cambridge Analytica and a growing awareness of just how much data we all generate every year, people are becoming more and more concerned with how this data is being used. I won’t chime in on this debate, but instead, I’d like to make a related point — if these companies are using my data, and making millions from it, why don’t I see any of the money?

The simple answer is that we all give our data away for free every day. More devices throughout your business than you might suspect collect data on your use patterns and anything else they can possibly detect or measure. You own the device or tool, but you’re letting it spill out your data for free. Ironically, it is using electricity you pay for to do it.

## **That device and/or sensor data is already out there**
Individual devices don’t have all that much data to distribute, but the total flow of information is huge. By some estimates, there are 27 Billion IoT enabled devices in the world today (Internet of Things — machines which collect data and send it to other machines, without human intervention or attention). In 10–12 years there will be 125 billion. More than 10 for every person alive, and many more than that for people in the developed world.

In less than 10 years, these devices will be producing and transmitting more than 180 zettabytes of data per year. That’s an 18 followed by 22 zeroes. All of this data, if nothing changes, will be harvested, aggregated, repackaged and sold by companies to other companies without so much as a ‘thank you’. Fortunes will be made from this data, but as the owners of the devices and indeed the sources of the data, we won’t see a penny.

This is, in an important and meaningful way, our data. We should share in those profits, don’t you think? Well, a company called MXC is working to make that possible.

## **What is MXC doing, and how does it actually work?**
MXC’s stated goal is to create a decentralized, global IoT economy. To make the data market something individuals and small companies can participate in, and profit from. They use blockchain technology to make the source (and original ownership) of each piece of data known and indelible. They are also building an LPWAN network to leverage this data and make it turn a profit for people like us.

Better still, the system ensures your data is transmitted and stored in an encrypted format — you can share the decryption codes for particular data with paying customers, and any potential hackers or data thieves will get nothing but useless noise.

Now, this is one of those situations where we need to define some terms.

- **What is the blockchain?**
Blockchain technology was developed as part of the invention of Bitcoin in 2008. However, it has a great deal of potential beyond mere cryptocurrency. It is a way of creating a history chain for a piece of data, an encrypted, un-alterable history which will run with that data throughout its life. That means that data collected and distributed under this system is no longer nameless, anonymous bits. One can tell who bout it, who sold it, and where it originated. If it was sold with the proviso that some fraction of that sale price goes back to the original owner (that’s you and me), you can’t erase that record either. You can read more about blockchain technology here.
- **What is an LPWAN network?**
A Low Power Wide-Area Network allows machines to communicate with each other directly and with central receivers. It draws very little power and has an extremely long range compared to your home or business wireless networks (WANs) but is very, very slow. It might only send a few thousand 1s and 0s every second, but that is more than enough for the usage data on a toaster, the error messages from a TV or the power consumption data for a concrete mixer.
So, MXC is making possible a revolution in how this data is collected, stored and paid for. Because the ownership of the data is encoded in the actual data, it never wholly belongs to anyone else. Universities, startups and even large corporations can search for the type of data they need, and buy it not from some third party company who owes you nothing, but in a way that sees you receive a fee.
## **Why would companies want to use blockchain-tagged data, anyway?**
Your first thought, if you’re a skeptic like me, was probably ‘if that’s all true, why would a business use this data at all? Why not just use the free variety? Well, there are 2 very good reasons.

- **First, most inexpensive datasets are of poor quality.**
There are a lot of technical challenges associated with collecting IoT data at the moment. As a result, there is an unfortunate amount of simple garbage data in those huge datasets. It takes expensive data manipulation to filter all that out, so ‘cheap data’ isn’t ‘cheap’ by the time it can be used. That’s the only reason the Data can be re-sold at all — it usually needs refining, and the refined (useful) data is expensive.
- **MCX’s system relies on the MXProtocol (Machine eXchange Protocol)**
This is a newer and much more robust system for handling data over LPWAN networks. It is heavily decentralized so that those corporations, universities or other organizations needing access to data can work directly with the people and businesses who have set up cloud-based repositories of their data. Literally, anyone can set up such a repository, and profit from the use of their own data.
## **What might this mean for the data industry?**
MCX’s innovation could really shake things up, in terms of making IoT data a much more visible, transparent and ethically trackable industry. More importantly for many, though, is the fact that any organization can set itself up to secure and even profit from their own data.

It is *ours*, after all. Why shouldn’t we be the ones to sell it?
